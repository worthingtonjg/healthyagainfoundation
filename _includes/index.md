This blog documents my struggles with Type 2 Diabetes and steps that have helped me improve my condition over time. By sharing my story I hope it may
motivate other people who have Type 2 Diabetes to take action in their lives. 

Please keep in mind that the opinions expressed below are NOT medical advice.  Please read my full disclaimer <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/disclaimer">here</a>.

This is just what worked for me.  This is what my body responded best to and what worked for me.  

Do not stop taking your medication or do anything I've done unless your doctor tells you that it is okay in your situation. 

Please note that I am a Type 2 Diabetic.  And that I was never on Insulin for my diabetes.  

Luckily, I acted soon enough to prevent that from being my reality.  If you are on Insulin be very careful about when and what you 
eat because you do not want your blood sugar to go low and you should follow your doctor's advice and please do not think that what 
worked for me might work for you.

I worked closely with a nutritionist and a doctor and without their help I would not have been successful.  


### My Story - Pre-diabetes diagnosis

In 2006 my family and I had just moved to Heber Utah.  I had spent the last 10 years working a more than full-time job
to try and support my family while at the same time trying to finish college.

I was 29 years old and my health was at its worst.  I was over 240 pounds.  I was not happy with my life and my unhappiness was taking a toll on me and my family.

I went to the doctor for a regular check up.  As part of the checkup he took my blood sugar, and told me that I was
pre-diabetic.  

I had also been told earlier that year that I had high cholesterol and high triglycerides.  

At the time, I really didn't know what any of that meant.  

And unfortunately the doctor didn't tell me that I needed to do anything.  The only thing he told me was to exercise more and eat healthier or I would have a problem later down the road.

I knew that my health wasn't good.  But I didn't know what to do to fix it.

Since I didn't really know the seriousness of what I was dealing with, I thought i could beat it alone.

### Thinking I could beat it alone was my worst mistake 

Over the next 9 years, I struggled with both my health and pre-diabetes.  

I did make some progress, I went from 240 pounds down to 215 pounds working through several diets.

But my diet and my exercise was not consistent.  And my blood glucose was getting progressively worse.  

I normal blood glucose reading for me was between 180 and 200  

Finally at the end of 2014 things came to a head when the Doctor said my A1c was 10.7

Also my Triglycerids where over 900 and my cholesterol was over 300.

I either needed to fix the problem.

I have to admit I was super scared.

The doctor suggested I start taking Metformin, 2000mg a day.

At this point I was willing to try anything.  I started taking it, and over the next six months I dropped 15 pounds.

My blood sugar was down in the 150 range.  Which was an improvement, but still wasn't enough.



### Why Diet and Exercise alone didn't work for me.

I tried for 9 years to beat my Diabetes on my own.  I tried every diet out there to lose weight.  I hit the treadmill endlessly 
and for hours but was not able to keep my Diabetes under control.  By the time reality shocked me into action my A1c was 10.7, 
my Triglycerids where over 1000, and my Cholesterol was just as bad.  If I didn't change something (and fast) I was going to 
have to go on Insulin.

I wasn't able to beat diabetes on my own with just diet and exercise.  My main problem was and will always be will power.  

None of us can be perfect.

And when you have type 2 diabetes every slip up in your diet or missed excercise can have consequences.  So to balance out your 
imperfections you need medication.  If you done correctly the medication won't be a forever thing.  But you have to get your body
back into line and the medication will help you do that. 

Please do not take as long as I took to realize you can't fix everything on your own.  Once I realized this I was able
to get by diabetes under control with a three-prong approach.
