This blog documents my struggles with Type 2 Diabetes and steps that have helped me improve my condition over time. By sharing my story I hope it may
motivate other people who have Type 2 Diabetes to take action in their lives. 

Please keep in mind that the opinions expressed below are NOT medical advice.  Please read my full disclaimer <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/disclaimer">here</a>.

This is what my body responded best to and what worked for me.  

Do not stop taking your medication or do anything I've done unless your doctor tells you that it is okay in your situation. 

Please note that I was on my way to being a Type 2 Diabetic.  But that I was never on Insulin for my diabetes.  

Luckily, I acted soon enough to prevent that from being my reality.  

If you are on Insulin be very careful about when and what you eat because you do not want your blood sugar to go low and you should 
follow your doctor's advice and please do not think that what worked for me might work for you.

I worked closely with a nutritionist and a doctor and without their help I would not have been successful.  

I am happy to say that today my fasting blood sugar is between 80 and 110.

It has been a long road, but I now know it is possible to accomplish.  

Please read my story and hopefully it will inspire you to make positive changes in your life and health. 

## My Story - Pre-diabetes diagnosis

In 2006 I was 29 years old and my health was at its worst.  I was over 240 pounds.  I was not happy with my life and my unhappiness was taking a toll on me and my family.

My family and I had just moved to Heber Utah for a new job.  I had spent the last 10 years working a more than full-time job
to try and support my family while at the same time trying to finish college.

I still had one more year of college left to graduate with Bachelors degree in Information Technology.

One morning I went to the doctor for a regular check up.  As part of the checkup he took my blood sugar, and told me that I was
pre-diabetic.  

I had also been told earlier that year that I had high cholesterol and high triglycerides.  

At the time, I really didn't know what any of that meant.  

And unfortunately the doctor didn't tell me that I needed to do anything.  The only thing he told me was to exercise more and eat healthier or I would have a problem later down the road.

I knew that my health wasn't good.  But I didn't know what to do to fix it.

Since I didn't really know the seriousness of what I was dealing with, I thought i could beat it alone.

### Thinking I could beat it alone was my worst mistake 

Over the next 9 years, I struggled with both my health and pre-diabetes.  

I did make some progress, I went from 240 pounds down to 215 pounds working through several diets.

But my diet and my exercise was not consistent.  And my blood glucose was getting progressively worse.  

At the end of 2014 a normal blood glucose reading for me was between 180 and 200.  

I could get it lower, but I had to exercise for an hour to do it, and the lowest I could ever get was 130.  

Finally at the end of 2014 things came to a head when the Doctor said my A1c was 10.7

Also my Triglycerids where over 900 and my cholesterol was over 300.

I needed to fix the problem or my health was going to continue to degenerate.

I have to admit I was super scared.

### Why Diet and Exercise alone didn't work for me.

I tried for 9 years to beat my Diabetes on my own.  I tried every diet out there to lose weight.  I hit the treadmill endlessly 
and for hours.  I did lose some weight but was not able to keep my Diabetes under control.  

I wasn't able to beat diabetes on my own with just diet and exercise.  My main problem was and will always be will power.  

None of us can be perfect.

And when you have type 2 diabetes every slip up in your diet or missed excercise can have consequences.  So to balance out your 
imperfections you need medication.  

Now if you done correctly the medication won't be a forever thing.  But you have to get your body back into line and the medication will help you do that. 

Once I realized this, I was able to get by diabetes under control with a three-prong approach.  

### My Three Pronged Approach

I beat my diabetes with a three pronged approach:  

1. Medication
2. Exercise
3. Diet

I don't think just one approach works.  I think all three were needed to get my body to fully respond and change the way I wanted it to change.

### How I beat Type 2 Diabetes with Medication

The biggest mistake I made was to resist / delay getting medical help.  I did this for several reasons:

1.  Doctor's didn't convey to me how serious the problem was
2.  I thought I could beat it myself through diet and excercise
3.  I was scared of being on a mediciation for the rest of my life
4.  I was scared to admit how bad my problem was.

Does any of this sound familiar?  

Please, Please don't wait.  I waited 9 years before taking medication.  I thought I could do it alone with diet and exercise.

Diabetes is a progressive disease that only gets worse and harder to beat if you do nothing, or if
you don't do enough to stop it's progression.

#### Metformin

At the end of 2014 the doctor suggested I start taking Metformin, 2000mg a day.

The worst (and only) side effect I have from it is really bad gas.  This can be embarrasing during the day, so to minimize this 
problem, I always take it at dinner so most of the problem happens while I sleep.  

If it get's really bad I sleep on the couch so my wife doesn't get grossed out.  

There are other medications out there.  But Metformin is the most prescribed medication because it has the fewest side effects.

One known possible side effect of Metformin is Lactic Acidosis.  But I never experienced this problem

#### My experience on Metformin

Taking Metformin has been a miracle for me.  Before I started taking Metformin my blood sugar was consistently above 180, and
sometimes above 200.  In the first 6 months taking Metformin I actually lost 15 pounds.  And my blood sugar stayed under 150
even with sporadic exercise and limited diet changes.

While we are talking about Medication, I think it is a good time to bring up measuring blood glucose.

#### Why I Measure My Blood Glucose

One thing you need to know is that **NOT** all doctor's are experts on diabetes.  One thing I heard from more than one doctor's is that
I didn't need to take my blood glucose daily if I was on Metformin and was a Type 2 Diabetic.

**This is terrible advice!**  

This advice mainly comes from the fact that Metformin will not make your blood sugar go too low.  People who take Insulin can
have their blood sugar go low - which is very dangerous.  You can die from low blood sugar very quickly.  

Whereas High Blood Sugar will only kill you slowly over time via Heart Disease, Kidney Failure, Blindness etc.

So I guess if you are okay with that, then feel free not to check your blood sugar regularly.  

I for one would rather live a long and quality life free from these problems.

#### How Often Do I Measure My Blood Glucose?

I know nobody likes to prick their finger (especially not multiple times a day).  But if you aren't measuring your blood sugar
then there is no way for you to know if what you are doing is being effective.

I check my blood sugar 3-4 times a day:

1.  When I wake up
2.  Before Lunch
3.  Before Dinner
4.  Before I go to bed

Why do I do this?

- The biggest reason is motivation.  
- When I see a high reading it motivates me to do something about it.  Exercise, eat less, etc.
- Likewise when I see consistantly good readings I know what I am doing is working so I can do more of it
- Measuring my blood sugar multiple times enabled me to make better choices about when to excercie and eat 
- If I could measure my blood sugar constantly I would!  

#### Medication wasn't enough 

Having my blood glucose lower was a great change for me.  But 150 blood glucose level wasn't good enough for me.  

At that level I was still causing damage to my organs and at risk of Heart Disease.  

Also it wasn't correcting my problem with High Triglycerids or Cholesterol. 

Finally I had no desire to be on a medication for the rest of my life.

So next I added exercise into my routine.  

### How I beat Type 2 Diabetes with Exercise

Keep in mind that up to this point I did exercise, but just not consistently.  Some weeks I would do it 3 times a week for 30 minutes, and other weeks only once.  

It was very hit or miss.

*At this point I realized that I needed to be religious with my excercise routine.  I needed to do it every day to see a change.*

I knew I had to make exercise a *habit* and part of my *lifestyle*.

#### How to Make Exercise a lifestyle

There are three strategies I found helpful to make exercise a lifestyle and a habit for me, and not just something I tolerated.

1.  I found activities I enjoy
2.  I find people to exercise with
3.  I Measure my blood sugar before and after exercising to see the result

#### Finding an activity I enjoy

For me the number one most important thing that has kept me exercising is finding something I enjoy.  I have to admit that I have always
enjoyed running.  But it is still running.  And slogging away on the treadmill (no matter if you like it) really isn't that enjoyable.

So I started to play racquetball 3 days a week.  

For me racquetball has changed my life.  I can play racquetball for an hour, and enjoy it so much that a barely notice how much time has gone by.
Now, don't misundestand me, it is a great work out.  I am covered in sweat by the time I am done, but I really enjoy doing it and look forward
to doing it each day.

I think the best thing you can do for yourself is to find the activity you love or look forward to doing.  For me that was racquetball, but for 
you it might be swimming or rollerblading. 

I still run or walk on the treadmill regularly but only when I can't play racquetball.

#### Find someone to exercise with

The second most important thing is finding somebody to do it with.  If you have somebody that you workout with regularly you will be far more likely 
to stick with it.

For racquetball that is almost required.  Although I do go by myself regularly and just hit the ball.  

I also have a buddy that I lift weights with. Having another person involved in my workouts has kept me going even when I didn't want to go.  It has 
helped me stay motivated and workout even on days when I might not otherwise do it.

#### Measure you blood sugar before and after exercising

And the third most important thing is taking my blood sugar before and after exercising to see the difference it makes.

I always time my exercise to be after meals.  That way I can take my blood sugar before my meal, then do my excercise.  Then take my blood sugar again after 
excercising or before the next meal.

By doing this, it really let's me see the difference that exercising makes.  

#### When to Exercise

One thing I found that helped me was to time my exercise when my blood glucose was at its highest.

So I started to excercise after meals.  

Usually after lunch and after dinner are times that I exercise.  And I use it as a tool to lower my
blood sugar and allow me to eat a more normal diet than I could otherwise.

I know that exercising after a meal doesn't sound fun, but for me it has really been life changing.

With the Metformin helping me keep my blood glucose under 150, adding the excercise in two hours after a meal 
can push my blood sugar down into the 110 - 120's. 

### Cardio

As I mentioned above, when I first started exercising I was doing mainly cardio.  Either by playing racquetball, or 
by running or walking on the treadmill.

And while this worked, I think it only worked to a point.  

I am definitely glad I started out with the cardio, because it allowed me to get into good enough shape to start a 
strength training program.

### Strength Training

Strength training is very important and has made a huge difference in my blood glucose.

Gaining more muscle has lowered my Insulin resistance and made permanent, measurable changes in my bodies cells.

I did cardio exclusively for over a year.  And I saw good results from it.  Typically if my blood sugar was in the 150 range before
the cardio, it would go down to the 110 and 120 range after the exercise.

Then at the start of 2016 I started doing a Strength training program with a friend at work.  Three days a week at lunch go to the gym at lunch time
and spend 30 minutes doing body weight exercises like: pushups, pullups, situps, squats, burpees.

We've been doing this for six months now, and I have seen a drastic change in my blood sugar.  

My fasting blood sugar is usually between 80 and 110 now.  And I haven't had a reading over 130 in many months since starting the routine.

### How I beat diabetes with Diet

At the same time I started to make exercise a habit in life, I also started to change my diet.

As a diabetic, I learned that I could simply not eat the same foods as other people and expect for things to be okay.

I found that my diet had to be very strict.  

And that means unfortunately there are many foods I just can't eat.  

But I also found that there are some specific foods that are really good for Diabetics and have helped me control my diabetes
to an extent that wasn't possible with just medication or exercise

#### Lesson 1 - Cheating on my Diet 

What I've learned is that nobody (especially me) is perfect.  I found that I just can't be perfect all the time on my diet.

Food is just too good.  

I love it too much.  

Whatever your favorite food "crack" is (For me it is Pizza), you won't be able to avoid it all the time.  

There will be times where you break down and eat foods you know are bad for you. 

And that is okay, but only IF ...

It is less than 20% of the time.  

Like most things in life, I try to follow the 80/20 rule, and things turn out okay.

I realized that I can minimize and offset the effect of what I eat by excercising at the right times, and eating better at other meals.

So early on, I realized (from sad experience) that I could not be perfect.  I planned on not being perfect.

I made a promise to myself to not let an imperfect meal destroy my entire day, week or month.  

I just remembered, each time, to tell myself to eat better at the next meal.  

I have found that if I can follow my eating rules 80% of the time then I will be far better off than not trying at all.    
 
#### When to eat

Diabetes is called the quite killer because often times there are no symptoms.  

But for me, if my blood sugar is high, then I get tingly and burning in my feet and toes.  It is entirely possible that this is the 
starting of permanent nerve damage, but I've never had that checked.  All I know is that for me it makes it very difficult for me to
sleep if my blood sugar is high.

So one of the best rules I have made for myself, that has literally been life changing for me is that ...

**I simply do not eat after 6pm.**

I know this sounds harsh but as a diabetic this is a fact of life you need to learn to live with.  

Now, if I was on Insulin, then this would probably NOT be a good rule to follow, since I may need to eat in conjuction with my 
Insulin shots.  But with Metformin, it works for me.  

I make sure to eat dinner before 6pm, and if necessary I exercise around 8pm to get my blood sugar down to a reasonable level.

Then I can go to sleep with blood sugar in the normal range - which means for at least 8 hours each day I have blood sugar that
is in a healthy range.

Just think - that means from this one simple trick (plus strategically timed excercising) ...

**I can keep my blood sugar in a healthy range for 33% of the time!** 

#### When not to eat

I have found that eating, in some cases, is more of a habit than a necessity for me.  I am not saying that I starve myself.  But
I am saying that I don't eat just because it is time to eat, or because other people are eating  

- If my blood sugar is high and I am not hungry then I will frequently skip a meal.
- Likewise if I know that I won't be able to exercise after a meal, and I am not too hungry then I may also skip a meal
- I have never skipped more than one meal in a row
- And I don't do this very frequently, but it can be a good tool to control your blood sugar in specific situations

#### What Not to Eat

For a diet to be successful it has to be a lifestyle change.  

As a diabetic, one of the main problems I have is that my cells and my blood are all messed up.  

Which means Insulin can't get into my cells when my blood and body are in this messed up state.  

I realized that fixing this can't happen overnight.  It took me years of unheathly eating habits to put my body in this state,
and it will take me years (and possibly a lifetime) to correct it.  

To do this, to start this change, I realized I had to change what I eat.

I had to change the way I thought about food.  

For me, I have changed my outlook on some types of food.  I have reprogrammed my brain to see the following foods as Diabetic Poison:

Diabetic Poison

- Sugar Drinks (Soda, Fruit Juice, Milk) 
- All fried food
- Cheese based meals (think pizza, enchiladas etc.)
- All Breads and Pasta
- White Rice
- Most Breakfast Cereal
- Fatty Meats
- Junk Food (Chips, Pop-tarts, Cookies, snacks etc)

I knew that if I wanted  change my body and my life then I needed to stop doing the following:

- Stop drinking my calories (no soda, no milk, no fruit juice)
- Stop eating fried food (Yes, that meant no French Fries, Onion Rings etc)
- Stop eating cheese based meals (seriously there is cheese on everything - and yes that means no Pizza or Enchiladas)
- Stop eating sweets (cake, donughts, candy etc.)
- Limit my bread consumption (unless it whole grain, high fiber - and then only sparingly)
- Limit the Fatty meats (hamburgers, hot dogs, etc.)
- Stop eating the Junk Food (bye-bye Strawberry Poptarts)

This list isn't exhaustive, there are other things I shouldn't eat as well, but I use my common sense to decide what is good or bad for me.   

I can tell you from experience this wasn't easy.  These things are hard to give up.  Food is a drug and I am addicted to it.

But I knew that if you want to beat the disease then I had to change what I ate (at least 80% of the time).

Do I still indulge in a slice of Pizza occasionall?  Or a handful of french fries?  Of course I do, I wouldn't be human if I didn't.

But this has changed from a daily occurence down to a weekly occurence.  And it has taken me over a year to get enough will power to 
resist these types of food at least 80% of the time.

#### What you should eat 

So we've talked about what I try not to eat.  Now let's talk about what I know I should eat:

- Vegetables (yes - you need to eat these with every meal, seriously there is no way around this)
- Lean Protien (eggs, turkey, chicken, fish)
- Fruit (in moderation and only before I excercise)
- Diabetes fighting food

I realize this list looks small, but it really isn't.  There are hundreds of kinds of vegetables.  I try to eat vegetables
with every meal now.  Which is actually a huge change for me.  I used to never eat vegetables (ever).  

I also switched the type of meat I typically eat.  Instead of hamburger and hotdogs (which where a staple of my diet), I now
eat eggs, turkey, chicken and fish (although I have a hard time with fish).

I do still eat Fruit, but it raises my blood sugar a lot, so I try to limit it to pre-workout snacks, or in the morning when my body is at it's most active.

Finally I have found a list of foods that have drastically helped me lower and control my blood sugar.  These foods are foods
that I call Diabetes Fighting Food, and I try to eat these every day. 

#### Diabetes Fighting Foods

I have used all the following foods to drastically lower my blood sugar.  

Keep in mind that I am doing this as part of a three pronged approach of medication, exercise and diet.  I didn't try these foods by themselves.  
Athough I suspect that they would work by themselves, but I don't think they will solve the problem unless you do all the steps.

- Lemons
- Cinnamon
- Whey Protein
- Old Fashion Oatmeal (non-instant kind) 
- Ground Flax Seed
- Chia Seed
- Blue Berries

#### Lemons

I found early on that using lemons in my diet lowers my blood sugar drastically.

The most effective way of doing this is by drinking lemon juice daily.  Now when I say lemon juice, I don't 
mean sugar filled lemonade.  I also don't mean squeezed lemon juice.  I mean whole, blended lemons and water.   

Below is how I make it

- Peel 3-6 lemons (depending on size)
- Slice the lemons up and throw them in a blender with some water
- Blend them up, then strain them to get the seeds and bigger chunks out
- Put in a 2 Qt pitcher and fill with more water to the top
- Drink this every day (I usually take a drink with breakfast and dinner)

Doing this one simple thing has made a drastic change in my blood sugar.  It might just be my body responding well to it, but if you look at my resources
page there scientific and medical evidence that lemons can lower your blood sugar naturally.

#### Cinnamon

Just like lemons, I have also found that Cinnaomon lowers my blood sugar drastically as well.  But I have to use quite a bit of it to make it effective.

Cinnamon is difficult to take by itself (unless you take Cinnamon pills).  So I use Cinnamon in two things ...

- My Whey Protien drink
- My Oatmeal (not the pre-packaged high glycemic stuff - you have to use the real authentic oatmeal that you have to boil) 

And I use a lot of it.  When I say a lot, I don't mean a little sprinkle.  I mean at least 1 tablespoon.  More if you can stand 
the strength.  But don't put too much in - you still have to be able to eat it.

Cinnamon has a natural ability of lowering blood sugar and it has definitely worked for me, and is something that I use every day.

#### Whey Protein Drink

When I started doing strength training I also started drinking a Whey Protien powder.  I use unsweetened almond milk, which only has 30 calories
to mix the protein powder with.  This also gives me something that tastes really good to put Cinnamon in, as well as Flax Seed and Chia seed.

Now one thing a diabetic learns early on is that they absolutely CANNOT drink their calories.  This is because calories in liquid form go into the 
blood stream so quickly and will immediately raise blood sugar levels.

So I was super surprised when I started drinking the protien shakes and my blood sugar did not raise.  In fact, not only did it not raise, it actually
was more reliably even.

I do put a large amount of Cinnamon in.  Also the almond milk is low in calories.  But I still expected to see my blood sugar levels go up, instead of 
remain steady.

The protien shake also keeps me full longer.  I normally use the protien shake in the morning as part of, or in replacement of breakfast.  And then sometimes
I use it just before or just after my strength training workout.  


#### Old Fashion Oatmeal

I am not a lover of Oatmeal, but I have come to like it for several reasons.  

Now just to clarify, when I talk about Oatmeal, this isn't the sugar
packed oatmeal that you get in the little packets and can be heated in the microwave.  That stuff is terrible for you and will raise your
blood sugar drastically.  

I am talking about the good old fashioned oats, the kind you have to boil on the stove. 

And no, I don't add any sugar to it.  Instead I add Cinnamon and/or Blueberries.  Both of which are super foods that lower
your blood sugar levels. 

#### Ground Flax Seed / Chia Seed Blend

These are both high in Omega-3's which for me is good because I don't eat a lot of fish.  Some people call flax seed the most powerful plant food
on the planet.  

There is evidence that it may help reduce your risk of heart disease, cancer, stroke and diabetes.

Flaxseed is also a great source of Lignans which are extremely beneficial to a diabetic and of course Fiber which is beneficial to everybody.

Chia seed, similar to Flax seed, is very high in fiber and both Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids.  There is evidence that chia seeds help digestion, heart health, and diabetes.

They also boost your metabolism and because they are high in calcium help you build stronger bones.

I put a chia and ground flax seed mixture in my Protien shake and I have seen a huge improvement in my blood lipids from doing this.

#### Blue Berries

I put blue berries in my Oatmeal, or eat a handful in the morning with my shake.

Blue berries are a diabetic super food and there is evidence that suggests blue berries help your body process glucose for energy more efficiently
by both increasing insulin sensitivity and regulating blood sugar levels.

### Where I am Today

I am super happy and blessed to be here today.  I though I could never be as healthy as I am.  

My fast blood sugar is now between 80 and 100.  It rarely goes above 130 during the day.  

I still have a bit more weight to go until I get down to the 160 pound goal the Doctor gave me.  But I am building muscle and continue to lower
my body fat percentage.

I really though I was doomed to a life of medication and a early death due to my diabetes and probably heart disease.

People say that diabetes can't be cured.  And in once sense I think they are correct.  If I go back to my old habits I think that my body will return
to its previously messed up state.

However if I continue with my health lifestyle I know I can maintain what I have earned. 

And I know you can do it to.

Please go to my resources page to view the many blog posts on topics that have helped me beat my diabetes.

Much of the information was summarized in my story above.  But more specific and detailed information can be found in the resouces 
section of the website.

I hope your journey to beat your diabetes is successful.  

If you have any questions about me or about anyting on this website feel free to contact me.

Best Regards and Good luck!
