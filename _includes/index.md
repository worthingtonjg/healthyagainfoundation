This blog documents my struggles with Type 2 Diabetes and steps that have helped me improve my condition over time. By sharing my story I hope it may
motivate other people who have Type 2 Diabetes to take action in their lives. 

### My Story - Pre-diabetes diagnosis

In 2006 my family and I had just moved to Heber Utah.  I had spent the last 10 years working a more than full-time job
to try and support my family while at the same time trying to finish college.

I was 29 years old and my health was at its worst.  I was over 240 pounds.  I was not happy with my life and my unhappiness was taking a toll on me and my family.

I went to the doctor for a regular check up.  As part of the checkup he took my blood sugar, and told me that I was
pre-diabetic.  

I had also been told earlier that year that I had high cholesterol and high triglycerides.  

At the time, I really didn't know what any of that meant.  

And unfortunately the doctor didn't tell me that I needed to do anything.  The only thing he told me was to exercise more and eat healthier or I would have a problem later down the road.

I knew that my health wasn't good.  But I didn't know what to do to fix it.

Since I didn't really know the seriousness of what I was dealing with, I thought i could beat it alone.
