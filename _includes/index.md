This blog documents my struggles with Type 2 Diabetes and steps that have helped me improve my condition over time. By sharing my story I hope it may
motivate other people who have Type 2 Diabetes to take action in their lives. 

Please keep in mind that the opinions expressed below are NOT medical advice.  Please read my full disclaimer <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/disclaimer">here</a>.

This is just what worked for me.  This is what my body responded best to and what worked for me.  

Do not stop taking your medication or do anything I've done unless your doctor tells you that it is okay in your situation. 

Please note that I was on my way to being a Type 2 Diabetic.  But that I was never on Insulin for my diabetes.  

Luckily, I acted soon enough to prevent that from being my reality.  If you are on Insulin be very careful about when and what you 
eat because you do not want your blood sugar to go low and you should follow your doctor's advice and please do not think that what 
worked for me might work for you.

I worked closely with a nutritionist and a doctor and without their help I would not have been successful.  

I am happy to say that today my fasting blood sugar is between 80 and 110.

It has been a long road, but I now know it is possible to accomplish.  

Please read my story and hopefully it will inspire you to make positive changes in your life and health. 

### My Story - Pre-diabetes diagnosis

In 2006 I was 29 years old and my health was at its worst.  I was over 240 pounds.  I was not happy with my life and my unhappiness was taking a toll on me and my family.

My family and I had just moved to Heber Utah for a new job.  I had spent the last 10 years working a more than full-time job
to try and support my family while at the same time trying to finish college.

I still had one more year of college left to graduate with Bachelors degree in Information Technology.

One morning I went to the doctor for a regular check up.  As part of the checkup he took my blood sugar, and told me that I was
pre-diabetic.  

I had also been told earlier that year that I had high cholesterol and high triglycerides.  

At the time, I really didn't know what any of that meant.  

And unfortunately the doctor didn't tell me that I needed to do anything.  The only thing he told me was to exercise more and eat healthier or I would have a problem later down the road.

I knew that my health wasn't good.  But I didn't know what to do to fix it.

Since I didn't really know the seriousness of what I was dealing with, I thought i could beat it alone.

### Thinking I could beat it alone was my worst mistake 

Over the next 9 years, I struggled with both my health and pre-diabetes.  

I did make some progress, I went from 240 pounds down to 215 pounds working through several diets.

But my diet and my exercise was not consistent.  And my blood glucose was getting progressively worse.  

At the end of 2015 a normal blood glucose reading for me was between 180 and 200.  

I could get it lower, but I had to exercise for an hour to do it, and the lowest I could ever get was 130.  

Finally at the end of 2015 things came to a head when the Doctor said my A1c was 10.7

Also my Triglycerids where over 900 and my cholesterol was over 300.

I needed to fix the problem or my health was going to continue to degenerate.

I have to admit I was super scared.

### Why Diet and Exercise alone didn't work for me.

I tried for 9 years to beat my Diabetes on my own.  I tried every diet out there to lose weight.  I hit the treadmill endlessly 
and for hours.  I did lose some weight but was not able to keep my Diabetes under control.  

I wasn't able to beat diabetes on my own with just diet and exercise.  My main problem was and will always be will power.  

None of us can be perfect.

And when you have type 2 diabetes every slip up in your diet or missed excercise can have consequences.  So to balance out your 
imperfections you need medication.  

Now if you done correctly the medication won't be a forever thing.  But you have to get your body back into line and the medication will help you do that. 

Please, do not take as long as I took to realize you can't fix everything on your own.  Once I realized this I was able
to get by diabetes under control with a three-prong approach.  

### My Three Pronged Approach

I beat my diabetes with a three pronged approach.  

1. Medication
2. Exercise
3. Diet

I don't think just one approach works.  I think all three were  needed to get my body to fully respond and change the way I wanted it to change.

### How I beat Type 2 Diabetes with Medication

The biggest mistake I made was to resist / delay getting medical help.  I did this for several reasons:

1.  Doctor's didn't convey to me how serious the problem was
2.  I thought I could beat it myself through diet and excercise
3.  I was scared of being on a mediciation for the rest of my life
4.  I was scared to admit how bad my problem was.

Does any of this sound familiar?  

Please, Please don't wait.  I waited 9 years before taking medication.  I thought I could do it alone with diet and exercise.

Diabetes is a progressive disease that only gets worse and harder to beat if you do nothing, or if
you don't do enough to stop it's progression.

#### Metformin

The doctor suggested I start taking Metformin, 2000mg a day.

The worst (and only) side effect I have from it is really bad gas.  This can be embarrasing during the day, so to minimize this 
problem, I always take it at dinner so most of the problem happens while I sleep.  

If it get's really bad I sleep on the couch so my wife doesn't get grossed out.  

There are other medications out there.  But Metformin is the most prescribed medication because it has the fewest side effects.

One known possible side effect of Metformin is Lactic Acidosis.  But I never experienced this problem

Links about Metformin and side effects:

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acidosis

#### My experience on Metformin

Taking Metformin has been a miracle for me.  Before I started taking Metformin my blood sugar was consistently above 180, and
sometimes above 200.  In the first 6 months taking Metformin I actually lost 15 pounds.  And my blood sugar stayed under 150
even without exercise or diet changes.

#### Why I Measure My Blood Glucose

While we are talking about Medication, I think it is a good time to bring up measuring blood glucose.

One thing you need to know is that NOT all doctor's are experts on diabetes.  One thing I heard from more than one doctor's is that
I didn't need to take my blood glucose daily if I was on Metformin and was a Type 2 Diabetic.

**This is terrible advice!**  

This advice mainly comes from the fact that Metformin will not make your blood sugar go too low.  People who take Insulin can
have their blood sugar go low - which is very dangerous.  You can die from low blood sugar very quickly.  

Whereas High Blood Sugar will only kill you slowly over time via Heart Disease, Kidney Failure, Blindness etc.

So I guess if you are okay with that, then feel free not to check your blood sugar regularly.  I for one would rather live a long
and quality life free from these problems.

#### How Often Do I Measure My Blood Glucose?

I know nobody likes to prick their finger (especially not multiple times a day).  But if you aren't measuring your blood sugar
then there is no way for you to know if what you are doing is being effective.

I check my blood sugar 3-4 times a day:

1.  When I wake up
2.  Before Lunch
3.  Before Dinner
4.  Before I go to bed

Why do I do this?

- The biggest reason is motivation.  
- When I see a high reading it motivates me to do something about it.  Exercise, eat less, etc.
- Likewise when I see consistantly good readings I know what I am doing is working so I can do more of it
- Measuring my blood sugar multiple times enabled me to make better choices about when to excercie and eat 
- If I could measure my blood sugar constantly I would!  

#### Medication wasn't enough 

Now 150 blood glucose level wasn't good enough for me.  

At that level I was still causing damage to my organs and at risk of Heart Disease.  Also it wasn't correcting my problem with High Triglycerids or Cholesterol. 

Finally I had no desire to be on a medication for the rest of my life.

So next I added exercise into my routine.  

### How I beat Type 2 Diabetes with Exercise

Keep in mind that up to this point I did exercise, but just not consistently.  Some weeks I would do it 3 times, and other weeks only once.  

It was very hit or miss.

At this point I realized that I needed to be religious with my excercise routine.  I needed to do it every day to see a change.

I knew I had to make exercise a habit and part of my lifestyle.

#### How to Make Exercise a lifestyle

There are three strategies I found helpful to make exercise a lifestyle and a habit for me, and not just something I tolerated.

1.  Find an activity you enjoy
2.  Find someone to do it with
3.  Measure your blood sugar before and after exercising to see the result

For me the number one most important thing that has kept me exercising is finding something I enjoy.

So I started to play racquetball 3 days a week and running or walking on the treadmill the other 2 days.

The second most important thing is finding somebody to do it with.

And the third most important thing is taking my blood sugar before and after exercising to see the difference it makes

With this I dropped another 10 pounds.

My blood sugar was getting better, but was still sporadic - some days it was 120, and other days it was 150

I was seeing improvement but not enough.

#### When to Exercise

One thing I found that helped me was to time my exercise when my blood glucose was at its highest.

So I started to excercise after meals.  

Usually after lunch and after dinner are times that I exercise.  And I use it as a tool to lower my
blood sugar and allow me to eat a more normal diet than I could otherwise.

I know that exercising after a meal doesn't sound fun, but for me it has really been life changing.

With the Metformin helping me keep my blood glucose under 150, adding the excercise in two hours after a meal 
can push my blood sugar down into the 110 - 120's. 

### Cardio

As I mentioned above, when I first started exercising I was doing mainly cardio.  Either by playing racquetball, or 
by running or walking on the treadmill.

And while this worked, I think it only worked to a point.  

I am definitely glad I started out with the cardio, because it allowed me to get into good enough shape to start a 
strength training program.

### Strength Training

Most important and will greatly improve your blood sugar over time.

### How I beat diabetes with Diet

At the same time I started to make exercise a habit in life, I also started to change my diet.

As a diabetic, I learned that I could simply not eat the same foods as other people and expect for things to be okay.

I found that my diet had to be very strict.  

And that means unfortunately there are many foods I just can't eat.  

But I also found that there are some specific foods that are really good for Diabetics and have helped me control my diabetes
to an extent that wasn't possible with just medication or exercise

#### Lesson 1 - Cheating on your Diet 

What I've learned is that nobody (especially me) is perfect.  I found that I just can't be perfect all the time on my diet.

Food is just too good.  I love it too much.  Whatever your favorite food "crack" is (For me it is Pizza), you won't be able to 
avoid it all the time.  

There will be times where you break down and eat foods you know are bad for you. 

And that is okay, but only IF ...

It is less than 20% of the time.  

Like most things in life, if you follow the 80/20 rule, things will be okay.

Also you can minimize the effect of what you eat by excercising at the right times, and eating better at other meals.

So right now, plan to not be perfect.  But don't let that destroy your entire day, week or month.  Just remember to tell yourself
to eat better at the next meal.  If you can follow your rules 80% of the time then you will be far better off than not trying 
at all.    
 
#### When to eat

Diabetes is called the quite killer because often times there are no symptoms.  But for me, if my blood sugar is high, then I 
get tingly and burning in my feet and toes.  It is possible that this is the starting of permanent nerve damage, but I've never
had that checked.  All I know is that for me it makes it very difficult for me to sleep if my blood sugar is high.

So one if the best rules that has been life changing for me is that I simply do not eat after 6pm.

I know this sounds harsh but as a diabetic this is a fact of life you need to learn to live with.  Now, if I was on Insulin, 
then this would probably not be a great rule to follow, since I may need to eat in conjuction with my Insulin shots.  But 
with Metformin, it works for me.  

I make sure to eat dinner before 6pm, and if necessary I exercise around 8pm to get my blood sugar down to a reasonable level.

Then I can go to sleep with blood sugar in the normal range - which means for at least 8 hours each day I have blood sugar that
is in a healthy range.

Just think - that means from this one simple trick (plus strategically timed excercising) I can keep my blood sugar in a healthy 
range for 33% of the time! 

#### When not to eat

I have found that eating, in some cases, is more of a habit than a necessity for me.  I am not saying that I starve myself.  But
I am saying that I don't eat just because it is time to eat.  

- If my blood sugar is high and I am not hungry then I will frequently skip a meal.
- Likewise if I know that I won't be able to exercise after a meal, and I am not too hungry then I may also skip a meal
- I have never skipped more than one meal in a row
- And I don't do this very frequently, but it can be a good tool to control your blood sugar in specific situations

#### What Not to Eat

For a diet to be successful it has to be a lifestyle change.  

As a diabetic, one of the main problems I have is that my cells and my blood are all messed up.  

Which means Insulin can't get into my cells when my blood and body are in this messed up state.  

I realized that fixing this can't happen overnight.  It took me years of unheathly eating habits to put my body in this state,
and it will take me years (and possibly a lifetime) to correct it.  

To do this, to start this change, I realized I had to change what I eat.

I had to change the way I thought about food.  

For me the following types of food are literally poisen as a Type 2 Diabetic:

- Sugar Drinks (Soda, Fruit Juice, Milk) 
- All fried food
- Cheese based meals (think pizza, enchiladas etc.)
- All Breads and Pasta
- White Rice
- Most Breakfast Cereal
- Fatty Meats
- Junk Food (Chips, Pop-tarts, Cookies, snacks etc)

I knew that if I wanted  change my body and my life then I needed to stop doing the following:

- Stop drinking my calories (no soda, no milk, no fruit juice)
- Stop eating fried food (Yes, that meant no French Fries, Onion Rings etc)
- Stop eating cheese based meals (seriously there is cheese on everything - and yes that means no Pizza or Enchiladas)
- Stop eating sweets (cake, donughts, candy etc.)
- Stop eating bread (unless it whole grain, high fiber - and then only sparingly)
- Limit the Fatty meats (hamburgers, hot dogs, etc.)
- Stop eating the Junk Food (bye-bye Strawberry Poptarts)

This list isn't exhaustive, there are other things I shouldn't eat as well, but I use my common sense to decide what is good or bad for me.   

I can tell you from experience this wasn't easy.  These things are hard to give up.  Food is a drug and I am addicted to it.

But I knew that if you want to beat the disease then I had to change what I ate (at least 80% of the time)

#### What you should eat 

So we've talked about what I try not to eat.  Now let's talk about what I know I should eat:

- Vegetables (yes - you need to eat these with every meal, seriously there is no way around this)
- Lean Protien (eggs, turkey, chicken, fish)
- Fruit (in moderation and only before I excercise)
- Diabetes fighting food


I realize this list looks small, but it really isn't.  There are hundreds of kinds of vegetables.  I try to eat vegetables
with every meal now.  Which is actually a huge change for me.  I used to never eat vegetables (ever).  

I also switched the type of meat I typically eat.  Instead of hamburger and hotdogs (which where a staple of my diet), I now
eat eggs, turkey, chicken and fish (although I have a hard time with fish).

I do still eat Fruit, but it raises my blood sugar a lot, so I try to limit it to pre-workout snacks.

Finally I have found a list of foods that have drastically helped me lower and control my blood sugar.  These foods are foods
that I call Diabetes Fighting Food, and I try to eat these every day. 


#### Diabetes Fighting Foods

I have used all the following foods to drastically lower my blood sugar.  Keep in mind that I am doing this as part of a three
pronged approach of medication, exercise and diet.  I didn't try these foods by themselves.  I suspect that they would work by 
themselves, but I don't think they will solve the problem unless you do all the steps.

- Lemons
- Cinnamon
- Whey Protein
- Old Fashion Oatmeal (non-instant kind) 
- Ground Flax Seed
- Chia Seed
- Blue Berries

#### Lemons

Using lemons in my diet lowers my blood sugar 30 - 50 points.  

Lemon Juice Drink
- Peel 3-6 lemons (depending on size)
- Slice the lemons up and throw them in a blender with some water
- Blend them up, then strain them to get the seeds and bigger chunks out
- Put in a 2 Qt pitcher and fill with more water to the top
- Drink this every day

#### Cinnamon

Just like lemons Cinnaomon lowers my blood sugar 30 - 50 points.  But you have to use quite a bit of it

I use Cinnamon in two things ...

- My Whey Protien drink
- My Oatmeal (not the pre-packaged high glycemic stuff - you have to use the real authentic oatmeal that you have to boil) 

And I use a lot of it.  When I say a lot, I don't mean a little sprinkle.  I mean at least 1 tablespoon.  More if you can stand 
the strength.  But don't put too much in - you still have to be able to eat it.

I also have taken Cinnamon pills, but I prefer to use Cinnamon in my food 

#### Whey Protein Drink

- Filling, Keeps you full
- Used as a delivery mechanism for the Cinnamon, Flax Seed and Chia seed
- Useful to build muscle
- Regulates my blood sugar


#### Old Fashion Oatmeal

I am not a lover of Oatmeal, but I have come to like it for several reasons.  Now when I talk about Oatmeal, this isn't the sugar
packed oatmeal that you get in the packs and can be heated in the microwave.  That stuff is terrible for you and will raise your
blood sugar drastically.  

I am talking about the good old fashioned oats, the kind you have to boil on the stove. 

And no, I don't add any sugar to it.  Instead I add Cinnamon and Blueberries.  Both of which are super foods that lower
your blood sugar levels. 

#### Ground Flax Seed / Chia Seed Blend

These are both high in Omega-3's which for me is good because I don't eat a lot of fish.  I put this mixture in my Protien shake
and I have seen a huge improvement in my blood lipids from doing this.

#### Blue Berries

Another diabetic super food.  I put these in my Oatmeal, or eat a handful in the morning with my shake.
