title: Quickstart guide to beating diabetes
---

This is my quickstart guide to beating diabetes.  This guide summarizes the steps that I have taken to beat my diabetes. Please keep in mind that this is merely an opinion blog.  It is the story of my struggle with Type 2 Diabetes and what has worked for me.  I am not a doctor 
or a registered dietician.  Please read the full <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/disclaimer">disclaimer</a>.

### Step 1: Admit you have a problem

It took me 9 years to fully admit that I had a problem with diabetes.  For 9 years I struggled with my weight and my diet.  I wasn't willing to admit
that I might need medical help to beat my diabetes.  I also wasn't committed to beating my diabetes enough to make the lifestyle changes
necessary to beat my disease.  

If this sounds like you then please keep reading.  

I finally admitted to myself that I could not win on my own.  I got medical help.  I made permanent diet changes.  I committed to a daily exercise routine. I completely
changed my lifestyle to beat my diabetes.

And you know what, it is working.  I feel like I am winning the battle.  

And so can you!

### Step 2: Get a blood glucose meter and start measuring your blood sugar

I quickly realized that I could not beat my diabetes if I didn't understand it.  The first step I took was to start taking my blood sugar.

I wasn't very good at this to begin with.  I didn't like to prick my finger multiple times a day (who does?)

But I quickly realized that I needed to be religious about taking my blood glucose if I was going to control it.

### Step 3: Get on medication

I spent 9 years before I realized that my diabetes would never get better on its own.  My diet and exercise were not enough.

### Step 4: Change how you eat

One thing I learned quickly was that to beat my diabetes I had to change my diet.  I quickly learned that I had to change what, how and when I ate.  The reality that I finally accepted was that I simply 
can't eat like everybody else.
