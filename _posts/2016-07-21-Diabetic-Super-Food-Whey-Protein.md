title: Diabetic Super Food - Whey Protein
---

As a Type 2 Diabetic, the one thing I learned early on is that I absolutely **CANNOT** drink my calories. 

This is because calories in liquid form go directly into my blood stream so quickly and will immediately raise my blood sugar levels.

So I was super surprised when I started drinking Whey Protein shakes and my blood sugar did not raise!

In fact, not only did it not raise, it actually suprisingly steady, even after eating a full meal.

It turns out there are some scientific reasons behind this.

### Benefits of Whey Protein

- Whey Protein has been shown to improve insulin response and reduce blood glucose response.
- Studies have also shown that consuming Whey Protein daily promotes weight loss
- Drinking Whey Protein directly before and after exercise enhances muscle growth and stimulates muscle hypertrophy
- Supplementing your diet with Whey Protein can prevent age-related muscle loss  
- Whey Protein makes you feel full longer

### What I take

When I started doing strength training I started drinking a Whey Protein powder.  

*However, if I had really known all of it's benefits I would have started taking Whey Protein much sooner.* 

The protein I use is [MuscleTech 100% Premium Gold Whey Protein](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MA28CJM){:target="_blank"}.  

I mainly choose this one because it was a good price at Walmart.  But it turns out that it also has great reviews on 
Amazon.com and in my opinion has been a great product for me.

One thing I like about this Whey Protein is that it is low in Carbohydrates.  It has only 4g total.  But it still tastes really 
good - just like a milk shake.  It comes in both Chocolate and Vanilla Ice Cream flavors.  Both of which I like.

### Preparation

I normally use the Whey Protein shake in the morning as part of, or in replacement of breakfast. And then sometimes I use it just before 
or just after my strength training workout.  It just depends on when is most convenient.

Here is how I prepare mine:

- 1 Scoop of 100% Premium Gold Whey Protein
- I mix it with unsweetened almond milk, which only has 30 calories. 
- I mix in healthy portion of [Cinnamon](/Diabetic-Super-Food-Cinnamon/) 
- I also add [Flax Seed](/Diabetic-Super-Food-Flax-Seed/) and [Chia seed](/Diabetic-Super-Food-Chia-Seed/)

I strongly suggest you get a shaker bottle.  Shaking the protien drink works much better than stirring.

### Benefits I've seen

Since starting the Whey Protein I have noticed several benefits:

- I feel full longer (and it feels great to be able to drink something other than water)
- My blood sugar does not spike nearly as much after meals
- I recover from workouts quite a bit faster.  

Even if I wasn't working out, I think I would see a benefit from taking the Whey Protein.  

The final reason I like the Whey Protein is because it gives me a tasty way to consume [Cinnamon](/Diabetic-Super-Food-Cinnamon/), 
as well as [Flax Seed](/Diabetic-Super-Food-Flax-Seed/) and [Chia seed](/Diabetic-Super-Food-Chia-Seed/).
