title: Diabetic Super Food - Vegetables
---

As a type 2 diabetic, the number one change I made in my diet was to simply eat
more vegetables.  Actually let me re-phrase that, because that was pretty much 
a lie.  Before I could start eating more vegetables, I had to start eating 
vegetables at all.

> Now I try to eat vegetables with every meal.

 This was probably one of the most difficult changes to make.  When you are used to
 eating lots of junk food like pizza, burgers and pop tarts, eating vegetables just
 does not sound appealing.
 
 However, as I started to give up my old favorite foods I had to replace them with
 something or simply not eat.  Since I couldn't starve myself I started eating 
 vegetables along with higher quality protein.
 
 The best types of vegetables for a type 2 diabetic to eat are dark leafy greens.

### Some vegetables are better than others 
 
Rich in calcium, vitamins A, B, C and K, magnesium, iron, protein, potassium and dietary fiber, dark leafy greens are perfect for a diabetic diet. 

Leafy greens include spinach, kale, broccoli, asparagus, Brussels sprouts, arugula, mustard or collard greens, romaine lettuce and chard. 

Each of these vegetables contains approximately 5 g of carbohydrates per serving, with a serving equal to 1 cup raw or a Â½ cup cooked vegetables. 

Eating a mixed green salad before or with your meal is a good way to incorporate leafy greens into your diabetic meal plan.

Anything on the list below can and should be included in a diabetic's diet:

1. Broccoli 
2. Arugula 
3. Beets 
4. Bok Choy 
5. Brussels Sprouts 
6. Cabbage 
7. Carrots 
8. Cauliflower 
9. Collard Greens
10. Eggplant 
11. Kale 
12. Mustard Greens
13. Onions
14. Peppers 
15. Spinach 
16. Tomato 
17. Turnip Greens 
18. Watercress 
19.  Celery

### Some vegetables you should avoid

Stick to smaller portions of starchy vegetables such as corn, potatoes, and peas. 

These items are nutritious, but should be eaten in moderation. The ADA groups them with grains because of their high carb content.
