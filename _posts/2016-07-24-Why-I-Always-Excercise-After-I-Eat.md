title: Why I (Almost) Always Exercise After I Eat
---

One thing I learned early on that helps me keep my blood glucose under control is excercise.  But when should you excercise?  The answer is any excercise is better than no exercise at all.  

But I have found that ...

> Exercising 2 hours after **every** meal helps me control my blood sugar.  

### Why do I excercise after eating instead of before?

Because that is when my blood sugar is at its highest.

So, I always time my exercise to be after meals.  

That way I can take my blood sugar before my meal, then do my excercise.  Then when I take my blood sugar again before the next meal I 
can see the effects that exercising has had.

By doing this, it really let’s me see the difference that exercising makes.

It turns out that there are some scientific reaons behind why exercising after meals works.

>Exercising increases your body’s insulin sensitivity, making it easier for insulin to transport glucose to the cells that will 
use it. So exercising after a meal can be a good way to “use up” excess glucose after eating.

Usually after lunch and after dinner are times that I exercise. 

- After lunch I typically do my strength training
- After dinner I do my cardio

### Why I don't exercise in the morning

The truth is, I think exercising in the morning would probably be a good idea. And if you can make it work for you then that is great! 

But I am simply not a morning person.  I can't get up early enough.  And since I am not eating after 6pm my blood sugar
is under control in the morning already. 

It is during the afternoon and evening when my blood glucose needs the most help to stay under control.

### Timing Exercise for Maximum Blood Glucose Control

I use exercise as a tool to lower my blood sugar and allow me to eat a more normal diet than I could otherwise.

I know that exercising after a meal doesn’t sound fun, **but for me it has really been life changing.**

Adding the excercise in two hours after a meal can push my blood sugar down into the 100 - 120’s depending on how well I ate
and if I am taking my Metformin correctly.

### It's impossible to be perfect

When I discovered the effect that exercise after eating had on my blood glucose levels I promised myself to always do it.

However, nobody is perfect.  It's just not possible to **always** exercise after meals:

- Your work schedule might now allow for it
- You might be travelling
- You might have a party or social gathering that gets in the way
- Or (my favorite) you might just not want to do it

There are lots of reasons that get in the way of making exercising after meals a habit. 

> But you have to have will power.  

In the last year, as I have become more committed to beating my Type 2 diabetes I have let fewer reasons prevent me from exercising 
when I know I need to do it to manage my disease.  

However, I am not always perfect.  I do miss workouts.  When I do my blood glucose is higher.  

There are, however, a couple of things that help offset this.

#### Metformin

The first is your medication.  Since I can't always be perfect I take Metformin. That helps me maintain a lower blood glucose level
even when I don't have time to exercise.  Or when I can't (or don't want to) be perfect.

#### Eat Low Glycemic Meals

The second is simply eating a diabetic friendly meal.  If you know you can't exercise or won't exercise after a particular meal, then eat mainly vegetables and high quality protein.  And completely avoid carbs and high-fat fried foods.  If you can learn to eat like this then a meal without exercise does not need mean a high blood glucose level.

#### Whey Protien as a Meal Replacement

The third tool I use in this situation is meal replacement.  For me, this typically happens either at breakfast or lunch.  If my blood
sugar is already high and I know I can't workout and there is no way for me to eat a diabetic friendly meal then I will replace
my meal with a Whey Protien shake.  Or, in the case of breakfast, if I don't have time to make something then a Whey Protien shake
is my breakfast of choice.  This will keep me going to the next meal, but not affect my blood glucose levels negatively.

#### Fasting used sparingly

Finally I use fasting as tool.  If I know I won't be able to exercise, and I am not too hungry then I will opt to skip the meal.  This 
has to be used carefully, and I only use it if I don't have Whey Protien on hand as a replacment.  In this case, I have to be careful to 
not over eat later to make up for the skipped meal. If I use this sparingly then it can be a healthy way for me to skip extra calories 
that my body might not need.
