title: Diabetic Super Food - Cinnamon
---

I started out using cinnamon in my oatmeal at breakfast.  I found that eating oatmeal (not the instant kind - that stuff will kill you), with a
good quantity of cinnamon on it actually lowers my blood sugar.  

At first I was using cinnamon to make the oatmeal taste a bit better without having to add sugar.  But as I began to add more 
cinnamon I noticed that my blood sugar would actually go down after breakfast.  

I now add quite a bit of cinnamon to my oatmeal.  I put as much in as I can without making the oatmeal unedible.  I am sure everybody
 has a different threshhold.  For me that is probably somewhere between a teaspoon and a tablespoon, although I haven't measured it
 that way.  I just sprinkle it on until it looks right.

I also use about the same amount of cinnamon in my whey protein shake.  I found that for me it makes the shake taste better, and has 
the same effect on my blood sugar as when I add it into oatmeal.

I have bought cinnamon pills, but never really enjoyed taking them, nor did I notice a difference in my blood sugar when I did.  It is 
possible that I just didn't take enough cinnamon this way for it to make a difference.  I am not big on pills and much prefer my 
cinnamon added into my food.

### What science and says about Cinnamon

If you do a search on cinnamon and diabetes you will see mixed opinions.  Some people say that cinnamon is just a spice and can have
no affect on your blood sugar.  

But many studies have been done that show using cinnamon not only decreases blood glucose levels, but also reduces total cholesterol,
LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides, and can increase HDL cholesterol.

### Conclusion

I have only ever taken cinnamon in conjuction with Metformin, diet and exercise.  I don't believe there is a magic pill for curing
diabetes, or that cinnamon is that magic pill.  But I have seen its effect on my blood glucose when used in conjunction 
with my Metformin, diet and exercise.  

For me using cinnamon does have a visible effect on my blood sugar, and as far as I can tell no bad side effects.  I don't plan
on replacing my Metformin with cinnamon, but I do think it is an additional strategy that has been working for me.

Below are some links that talk about cinnamon.  Because cinnamon is a spice there is some controversy over whether or not it
really can have a positive effect on your blood sugar.  I can only tell you how it works for me.  Do your own research and
