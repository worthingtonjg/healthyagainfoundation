title: Three keys to beating diabetes
---

This is a short post, but a very important one, because I am here today to tell you that I have personally beat diabetes!  And so can you!

> Beating my diabetes has not been easy.  It has meant making complete and permanent lifestyle changes.  I have had to change the way 
I think about food, my body and my life. 

Through  my 10 year struggle to beat diabetes, I have found that diabetes can be beat but never fully eradicated.  The cure to diabetes
is living a new life, eating healthy foods, and taking care of your body.  And while there is medication you can take, and food that
will help you in your struggle, there really is **NO MAGIC PILL** to cure diabetes.

However, through my struggle I have found **three keys** that I use daily to beat my diabetes: 

1.  Medication
2.  Exercise
3.  Diet

For me just one or two aproaches don't work.  I have tried excercise on its own. I have tried diet on its own. I have tried diet and exercise. I have tried just medication.
  
I tried every combination of the above and got *some* positive results.  

However nothing worked for me fully until ...

> I applied all three keys to my lifestyle.  

My body needs all three keys to fully respond and change in the ways that I wanted for it to change.

Let's be honest.  Most of us got into this situation because we lacked the will power to control our eating habits.  The simple 
fact is that food is delicious.  Especially food that isn't good for diabetes.  None of can control our diet 100% of the time.  And 
with diabetes, eating the wrong thing will immediately and adversely affect your blood glucose.

Since we can't be perfect with our diet 100% of the time.  We can add exercise into our lifestyle.  But exercise is hard.  There
will be days where you don't have the time, or just don't want to exercise as hard, or at all.  This is life.  There is no doubt
that exercise when timed right has been one of the best tools to fighting my diabetes.  But I have to honestly say that it is 
really hard to always exercise when I am supposed to.

That is where medication comes in.  Taking medication, specifically Metformin for me has helped me moderate my blood sugar during
those times of weakness when I don't or can't use diet and exercise.  It has allowed me to get a handle on my diabetes in a way
that I simply could not with just diet and exercise.  I simply could not have started to beat my diabetes without medication 
being one of the three keys.  I know because I tried very hard for 9 years trying to do it. 

While this is a short post, it is a very important one.  I spent 9 years trying to figure out how to beat my diabetes.  I simply
could not do it with just one or two strategies.  It has taken all three keys to see start seeing positive progress in my 
struggle.
