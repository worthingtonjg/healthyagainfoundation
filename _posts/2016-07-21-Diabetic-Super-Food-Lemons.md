title: Diabetic Super Food - Lemons
---

Lemons are the first food that I found that actually lowered my blood sugar.  I actually ran across it by accident one day
when I decided to make my own lemonade.  

I took several large lemons, peeled them and chopped them up.  Then I added them 
to a blender full of water.  After blending it, I used a strainer to get the really large pulp bits and seeds out of the 
liquid.  I then added more water to make 2 quarts.  

I have to say that at first the taste is really strong.  But at this point, as a type 2 diabetic, I was tired of not being able to 
drink anything and I had read that lemons where relatively low in sugar.

I have to say though, what I found was really shocking.  After drinking the lemon juice this way I started to see some pretty 
significant drops in my blood sugar.

Once I realized this I started drinking at least 2 cups of this a day.  

### Science behind why lemons are good for diabetes

Research has shown that lemon lowers the glycemic index of any food it is added to. And... we are not talking a few points here.  The drop 
is very significant! To benefit from this, all you have to do is add a little squeeze of fresh lemon over your food. Almost like waving a 
magic wand, this will instantly lower the glycemic index of your meal.

Although lemons contain a weak acid, when they are metabolized by the body they have an alkalizing effect. If fact, they are the strongest alkalizing food you can eat! This is why adding lemon to your diet can go a long way toward restoring the pH of your body to the alkaline side where it should be. It has been found that most diabetics have a very acidic body pH (as have cancer patients). Bringing back to the alkaline side will go a long way toward helping to cure your diabetes

Consuming the soluble fiber found in lemons may help you to better manage your diabetes condition. Soluble fiber helps stabilize your blood glucose levels and keep them within a healthy range by helping your body to slow down its absorption rate of sugars.

Lemon contain polyphenols, which plays a major role in minimizing insulin resistance.

Flavanones, are found in all citrus peels.  n addition to controlling blood glucose, the antioxidant properties of the flavones have been linked to the management of radical damage and inflammation, both of which are prevalent in type 2 diabetes.
