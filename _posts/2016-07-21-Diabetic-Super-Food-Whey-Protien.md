title: Diabetic Super Food - Whey Protien
---

As a Type 2 Diabetic, the one thing I learned early on is that I absolutely *CANNOT* drink my calories. 

This is because calories in liquid form go directly into the blood stream so quickly and will immediately raise blood sugar levels.

So I was super surprised when I started drinking whey protien shakes and my blood sugar did not raise. 

In fact, not only did it not raise, it actually was more reliably even.

It turns out there are some scientific reasons behind this.

- Whey protien has been shown to improve insulin response and reduce blood glucose response.
- Studies have also shown that consuming whey protien daily promotes weight loss
- Drinking Whey protien directly before and after exercise enhances muscle growth and stimulates muscle hypertrophy
- Supplementing your diet with Whey protein can prevent age-related muscle loss  
- Whey protien makes you feel full longer

### How I take Whey Protien


When I started doing strength training I started drinking a Whey Protien powder.  However, if I had really known all of it's 
benefits I would have started taking Whey Protien much sooner. 

The protien I use is MuscleTech 100% Premium Gold Whey Protien.  I mainly choose this one because it was a good price at Walmart.

It turns out that it also has great reviews on Amazon.com

I use unsweetened almond milk, which only has 30 calories to mix the protein powder with. This also gives me something that tastes really good to put Cinnamon in, as well as Flax Seed and Chia seed.

I do put a large amount of Cinnamon in. Also the almond milk is low in calories. But I still expected to see my blood sugar levels go up, instead of remain steady.

The protien shake also keeps me full longer. I normally use the protien shake in the morning as part of, or in replacement of breakfast. And then sometimes I use it just before or just after my strength training workout.
