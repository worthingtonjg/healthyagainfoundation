title: Diabetic Super Food - Whey Protien
---

As a Type 2 Diabetic, the one thing I learned early on is that I absolutely *CANNOT* drink my calories. 

This is because calories in liquid form go directly into the blood stream so quickly and will immediately raise blood sugar levels.

So I was super surprised when I started drinking whey protien shakes and my blood sugar did not raise. 

In fact, not only did it not raise, it actually was more reliably even.

It turns out there are some scientific reasons behind this.

### Benefits of Whey Protien

- Whey protien has been shown to improve insulin response and reduce blood glucose response.
- Studies have also shown that consuming whey protien daily promotes weight loss
- Drinking Whey protien directly before and after exercise enhances muscle growth and stimulates muscle hypertrophy
- Supplementing your diet with Whey protein can prevent age-related muscle loss  
- Whey protien makes you feel full longer

### How I take Whey Protien

When I started doing strength training I started drinking a Whey Protien powder.  However, if I had really known all of it's 
benefits I would have started taking Whey Protien much sooner. 

The protein I use is MuscleTech 100% Premium Gold Whey Protien.  I mainly choose this one because it was a good price at Walmart.
But it turns out that it also has great reviews on Amazon.com and in my opinion has been a great product for me.

One thing I like about this Whey Protien is that it is low in Carbohydrates.  It has only 4g total.  But it still tastes really 
good - just like a milk shake.

I mix it with  unsweetened almond milk, which only has 30 calories. 

They Whey Protien also gives me a medium that tastes really good to put [Cinnamon](/Diabetic-Super-Food-Whey-Protien/) in, as well as 
[Flax Seed](Diabetic-Super-Food-FlaxSeed/) and [Chia seed](Diabetic-Super-Food-ChiaSeed/).

I normally use the protien shake in the morning as part of, or in replacement of breakfast. And then sometimes I use it just before 
or just after my strength training workout.  It just depends on when is most convenient.

Since starting the Whey protien I have noticed several benefits:

- I feel full longer (and it feels great to be able to drink something other than water)
- My blood sugar does not spike nearly as much after meals
- I recover from workouts quite a bit faster.  

Even if I wasn't working out, I think I would see a benefit from taking the Whey Protein.
