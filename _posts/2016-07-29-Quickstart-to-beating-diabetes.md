title: Quickstart guide to beating diabetes
---

This is my quickstart guide to beating diabetes.  This guide summarizes the steps that I have taken to beat my diabetes.   

This guide and is **not** comprehensive *- hence the term 'quickstart'.*  

It is meant to be a *brief summary* of the steps I have taken to beat diabetes.  It outlines what I have done, but does not go 
into detail about why I did it, or the exact results I have seen by doing it.  

You can learn more about the each step by visiting the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/diabetes-resources">Resources page</a>. 

If you haven't already done so read <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/">My Story.</a>

> Please keep in mind that this is merely an opinion blog.  It is the story of my struggle with Type 2 Diabetes and what has worked for me.  I am not a doctor 
or a registered dietician.  Please read the full <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/disclaimer">disclaimer</a>.

### Step 1: Admit you have a problem

It took me 9 years to fully admit that I had a problem with diabetes.  For 9 years I struggled with my weight and my diet.  I wasn't willing to admit
that I might need medical help to beat my diabetes.  I also wasn't committed to beating my diabetes enough to make the lifestyle changes
necessary to beat my disease.  

If this sounds like you then please keep reading.  

I finally admitted to myself that I could not win on my own.  I got medical help.  I made permanent diet changes.  I committed to a daily exercise routine. I completely
changed my lifestyle to beat my diabetes.

And you know what, it is working.  I feel like I am winning the battle.  

And so can you!

### Step 2: Get a blood glucose meter and start measuring your blood sugar

I quickly realized that I could not beat my diabetes if I didn't understand it.  The first step I took was to start taking my blood glucose.

I wasn't very good at this to begin with.  I didn't like to prick my finger multiple times a day (who does?)

But I quickly realized that I needed to be religious about taking my blood glucose if I was going to control it.

### Step 3: Get medical help

It took me 9 years before I admitted to myself that my diabetes would never get better on its own.  My diet and exercise were 
not enough.  I finally got to a breaking point where I knew that I needed help.  

#### Measure your A1c and Blood lipids

You need to get your A1c (which is a long term measure of your blood glucose) and your Blood lipids (ie. Cholesterol and Triglycerides)
measured by your doctor.  These tests will give you a bigger picture of your health and what you need to change.  High blood
glucose levels often go hand-in-hand with high cholesterol and triglyceride levels.  All of which are indicators of heart disease.

You should get these tests done every 3 - 6 months so you can track your progress and make sure what you are doing is being effective
in your fight against diabetes.

#### Get on Medication

The medication that I use for my diabetes is Metformin.  

I have friends who are on Insulin and I have watched them ride the roller coaster that Insulin causes.  I didn't want that to 
be me.  And I didn't want to be on medication for life.

But after 9 years, I realized my blood glucose levels where only getting worse over time and not better.  And that if I didn't make
changes immediately then I would be on Insulin.

That is when I asked for help, and the doctor prescribed me Metformin.  

For those of you with the same fears as me, the worst side effect that I have had is really bad gas.
There are other risks with Metformin, but I have not experienced those first hand.  Metformin might not be good for everyone.  Only 
your doctor can make that recommendation and help you decide what is best for you.

Whatever medication you are prescribed, make sure you take it every day.  Things will get better if you stay on your medication 
and add both diet and exercise into your lifestyle.  

As I have worked with my doctor and made the lifestyle changes necessary to beat my diabetes, I have gone from 2000mg a day down 
to 500mg a day.  My blood sugar readings have gone from 200-150 regularly down to 120-80 regularly.

And one day I hope to be completely free of taking any drug to manage my diabetes.

### Step 4: Change how you eat

One thing I learned quickly was that to beat my diabetes I had to change my diet.  I quickly learned that I had to change what, 
how and when I ate.  

> The reality that I finally accepted was that I simply can't eat like everybody else.  

#### I changed when I ate

As a diabetic, **when** you eat is very important.  

**Rule 1: I no longer eat after 6pm if I can help it.**  

Following this one rule helps me to have a lower blood sugar all night.  

That is a full 8 hours, or 33% of a day when my blood sugar can easily be in a normal range!  

For those of you who are wondering, this also includes not eating the late night or after dinner snacks.  And yes, for me this 
one change was probably the hardest thing I did, but it also has had one of the biggest impacts on my blood glucose.  

**Rule 2: Don't eat out of habit**

I have found that eating is really as much of a habit as it is a necessity.  I quickly realized that I was often eating either
out of habit, or because other people where eating and snacking.  I had to re-train myself to only eat when I was truly hungry
and not just because the food is there, or because other people are eating.  

#### I stopped eating these foods

I realized that as a diabetic certain foods are just off limits for me.  High blood glucose is not just caused by ingesting sugars.
But also by insulin intolerance due to high levels of fats in your blood (triglycerides).  

I had to start thinking about food like a drug.  And some foods are literally poisens to a diabetic

I knew that if I wanted  change my body and my life then I needed to stop doing the following:

- Stop drinking my calories (no soda, no milk, no fruit juice)
- Stop eating fried food (Yes, that meant no French Fries, Onion Rings etc)
- Stop eating cheese based meals (seriously there is cheese on everything - and yes that means no Pizza or Enchiladas)
- Stop eating sweets (cake, donughts, candy etc.)
- Limit my bread consumption (unless it whole grain, high fiber - and then only sparingly)
- Limit the Fatty meats (hamburgers, hot dogs, etc.)
- Stop eating the Junk Food (bye-bye Strawberry Poptarts)

This list isn't exhaustive, there are other things I shouldn't eat as well, but I use my common sense to decide what is good or bad for me.   

#### I started eating these foods

I also started eating more of what was good for me.  

The most important food to eat more of as a diabetic is **vegetables.**  

This means that with every meal, I try my best to eat green leafy vegetables.  Trust me, this was a hard change for me to make.
But based on personal experience eating vegetables has been key to me beating my diabetes.

I also changed the type of protien I eat.  Instead of eating fatty protien like ground beef, I try to eat more lean protiens
like eggs, turkey, chicken and fish.  

Fruit for a diabetic is a two edged sword.  Fruit can be healthy, especially berries.  But it can also cause your blood glucose 
to spike.  So I only eat fruit in moderation either at breakfast when my blood glucose is at its best, or before a workout when
I know I am going to burn my blood glucose down.

Finally there is a whole list of diabetic fighting foods that I eat regularly and have helped me to drastically reduce my 
blood sugar.  

I drink Whey Protien every day mixed with Flax Seed, Chia Seed and Cinnamon.  This has greatly increased my good cholesterol, keeps
me feeling fuller throughout the day, and moderates my blood sugar.  It also gives me something that I can drink that tastes
pretty good and that doesn't raise my blood sugar.

I also drink Lemon water (I blend lemons in water - no added sugar).  I have found that this also lowers my blood sugar.  Lemons
are one of the only fruits that don't raise blood sugar.  I really like this because it gives me something that I can drink instead
of sugar filled soda's or diet drinks.

I often eat Oatmeal mixed with Blue Berries or Cinnamon or both.  Now just to clarify, when I talk about Oatmeal, this isn't the sugar
packed oatmeal that you get in the little packets and can be heated in the microwave.  That stuff is terrible for you and will raise your
blood sugar drastically.  This is the authentic oatmael that you have to boil.  Instead of adding sugar to it I add either 
Blue Berries and/or Cinnamon.  Both of which greatly lower my blood glucose.    

All of these foods when prepared and ingested correctly have had a positive combined effect on managing my blood sugar
and helping me beat diabetes  

### Step 7: Start exercising after every meal

One thing I learned was that my blood sugar often times would not come down on its own after a meal.  Especially if that meal
was too high in carbs or fats, or was simply too big for my body to handle.  So to control my blood glucose I started to time
my exercise to be after my meals.  

On a good day, I exercise after every single meal.  Doing this has given me more control over my diabetes and allows me to keep
my blood sugar in a more healthy range.  It also allows me to be less perfect with my diet.  Although I try my hardest to not
eat things I know aren't good for me.  

I do both Cardio and Strength training.  I started out with just cardio.  I lost 60 pounds doing just cardio.  However, it wasn't
until I added Strength training that I noticed a more permanent change in my blood glucose numbers.  I think both cardio and 
strength training have their benefits and I strongly suggest doing a mix.  

### Step 8: Staying committed

For me I have learned that beating diabetes means making permanent lifestyle changes.  I have to change the way I think about 
life, food and exercise.  I have had to be more committed to beating diabetes than I am to anything else in my life.

I have learned that it takes time to change.  I have found that I have to be very consistant with my diet, exercise and medication
over long periods of time to see small changes.

I have found that making new habits and changing old ones is hard.  But at the same time it is so worth it.

Finally I have found that no one is perfect.  But I try to be as close to perfect with my diet, exercise and medication as I can at
least 80 percent of the time.
