Let me start out by clarifying...  

>When I talk about Oatmeal, I am not talking about the instant kind that comes out of the little packet and that you heat in the microwave.  

That type of oatmeal is **NOT** good for diabetics.  It has less soluble fiber and is usually packed full of added sugar.  

The oatmeal I am talking about is *good old fashioned, plain, steel cut oats* that you have to boil. 

Oatmeal offers a host of health benefits, and is often thought of as a great go-to food for those with diabetes. I have found that 
eating foods that are high in fiber and nutrients but low in fat and sugar can help me maintain a healthy blood sugar level, as well 
as improve my overall health.

Because oatmeal has a low glycemic index, it helps to maintain my blood glucose levels. 

Oatmeal can also promote heart health, which is important because diabetes patients are prone to heart disease.

### Effects of oatmeal in my diet

Adding oatmeal to my diet has had many beneficial effects: 

- It has helped regulate my blood sugar, thanks to the high fiber and low glycemic index.
- It’s heart-healthy and has helped to lower my cholesterol.
- It’s high in fiber, and helps me feel full longer
- It’s a good source of long-term energy.
- It has helped to regulate my digestion.

As a type 2 diabetic, when adding oatmeal to my diet, there are several things I have found that work and don't work:

### How to eat your oatmeal

The following things help me keep my blood sugar low:

- Adding cinnamon, nuts, or berries.
- Choose Irish or steel cut oats.
- Use low-fat milk or water

### Things you should avoid

As a type 2 diabetic, I have found that just as there are several great choices that I can make when preparing oatmeal, there 
are several choices that can be detrimental to my health:

- I don’t use prepackaged or instant oatmeal.
- I don't add too much fruit
- I do not add any sweetner or sugar
- I Don't use cream

Instant and flavored oatmeal often comes full of added sugar and salt, neither of which is good for a diabetes diet. They 
also have less soluble fiber. Always choose Irish or steel cut oats.  

Adding sweetner or sugar in any form is bad for my blood sugar.  This includes, sugar, honey, brown sugar or syrup.

### Other benefits of eating oatmeal

In addition to the blood sugar and heart health benefits that oatmeal offers, it can help with:

- lowering cholesterol
- weight management
- skin protection
- reducing chances of colon cancer

Oatmeal is slow to digest, meaning that you’ll feel full longer. This can help with weight loss and weight management goals. It can 
also help to regulate the skin’s pH, which can reduce inflammation and itching.

### Conclusion

When prepared correctly, oatmeal has a host of health benefits that can be beneficial to anyone, but especially to those 
with diabetes. You can start the day with a meal that regulates blood sugar and provides a long-term source of energy, 
as well as improves your heart health. By choosing the right add-ins, and avoiding the wrong ones, oatmeal can be an ideal 
breakfast for those with diabetes.
