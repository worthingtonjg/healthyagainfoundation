title: Why I Don't Eat After 6pm
---

So one of the best rules I have made for myself, that has literally been life changing for me is that **I simply do not eat after 6pm.**
I know this sounds harsh but as a Type 2 diabetic this is a fact of life that I've learned to live with.  

Diabetes is called the quite killer because often times there are no symptoms.  

For me, if my blood sugar is high, then I get tingly and burning in my feet and toes.  It is entirely possible that this is the 
starting of permanent nerve damage, but I've never had that checked.  All I know is that for me it makes it very difficult for me to
sleep if my blood sugar is high.

Now, if I was on Insulin, then this would probably **NOT** be a good rule to follow, since I may need to eat in conjuction with my 
Insulin shots.  

But with Metformin, it works for me. 

### Whenever Possible, I eat Dinner before 6pm 

Whenever possible, I make sure to eat dinner before 6pm, and if necessary I exercise around 8pm to get my blood sugar down to 
a reasonable level.

Then I can go to sleep with blood sugar in the normal range - which means for at least 8 hours each day I have blood sugar that
is in a healthy range.

Just think - that means from this one simple trick (plus strategically timed excercising) ...

**I can keep my blood sugar in a healthy range for 33% of a 24 hour period!** 

### Other times I don't eat

I have found that eating, in some cases, is more of a habit than a necessity for me.  I am not saying that I starve myself.  But
I am saying that I don't eat just because it is time to eat, or because other people are eating.  Which is actually a lot harder
than it sounds.  Human beings are creatures of habit.  We are social creatures and eating is part of our social activities.

To beat my Type 2 Diabetes I try to follow these rules:

- If my blood sugar is high and I am not hungry then I will frequently skip a meal.
- If am too hungry to skip a meal, but my blood sugar is high, them I will drink a Whey Protien shake instead.
- Likewise if I know that I won't be able to exercise after a meal, and I am not too hungry then I may also skip a meal
- I have never skipped more than one meal in a row
- And I don't do this very frequently, but it can be a good tool to control your blood sugar in specific situations.

If you do decide to skip a meal, make sure you don't over compensate later.  You have to have a lot of self control to do this. Otherwise in most cases you might end up over-eating to make up for the lack of calories you skipped.  Which can actually end 
up having the opposite effect on your blood sugar.

### Other benefits of not eating after 6pm

As I already mentioned the biggest benefit I have found from not eating after 6pm is that my blood sugar is typically a lot lower
while I am sleeping.  But there are a list of other benefits as well:

#### Helps me to avoid Heartburn

It is a fact that eating late at night keeps your stomach busy, continuing to produce gastric acids in an excessive amounts. When you lie down shortly after your meal, the acids are pushed into your lower esophageal sphincter, irritating the latter resulting in heartburn. This worsens when you lie down on your stomach.

#### Helps me get better sleep

Studies show that eating does have an effect on your sleep since those who ate late at night had a difficult time going into deep sleep. It is because when you eat close to your bedtime your stomach is still working hard to digest your food, during this time your stomach is required to rest and recuperate. In effect, sleep deprivation slows down your metabolism leading to faster weight gain.

#### Helps me not gain extra weight

Studies reveal that there is a relation between eating especially large meals late night and weight gain. When you eat late, it causes the rising of triglyceride levels which in turn signals the body to store fat used to produce energy. Since no physical activity is done during nighttime, the fats remain in our body without being burned. Hence, this results to weight gain.

#### Keeps me from late night snacking

When you eat beyond 8 p.m. chances are you are too hungry that you forget to consider your caloric intake. Due to the need to satiate yourself after a long gap from your last meal you eat more than necessary. This ensures that needless calories will be consumed then stored as fat once it is processed.

### Conclusion

I can find a lot of people arguing against the idea that not eating after a certain time makes a difference.  In fact for 
every website I can find in favor of the idea, I can find another saying that it makes no difference.

All I can say is:  

Every person's body is different.  So just do what works for you.  

For me, it has been a wonderful tool to control my blood glucose levels in the evening and my fasting blood glucose levels in the morning.
