title: Why Type 2 Diabetics Should Take Their Blood Sugar
---

One thing I heard from more than one doctor's is that I didn't need to take my blood glucose daily if I was on Metformin and was 
a Type 2 Diabetic or pre-diabetic.

**This is terrible advice!**

One thing you need to know is that **NOT** all doctor's are experts on diabetes.  

This advice mainly comes from the fact that Metformin will not make your blood sugar go too low.  People who take Insulin can
have their blood sugar go low - which is very dangerous.  You can die from low blood sugar very quickly.  

Whereas high blood sugar will only kill you slowly over time via Heart Disease, Kidney Failure, Blindness etc.

So I guess if you are okay with that, then feel free not to check your blood sugar regularly.  

I for one would rather live a long and quality life free from these problems.

### How Often Do I Measure My Blood Glucose?

I know nobody likes to prick their finger (especially not multiple times a day). But if you arenâ€™t measuring your blood sugar then 
there is no way for you to know if what you are doing is being effective.

I check my blood sugar 3-4 times a day:

1.  When I wake up
2.  Before Lunch
3.  Before Dinner
4.  Before I go to bed

When i started doing this my blood sugar ranged between 130 and 200. (Yeah - this was bad, and if this sounds like you then keep reading).  

Today with medication, diet and exercise my blood sugar typically ranges between 80 and 130 throughout the day.  Keep in mind that
is on a good day, which is most the time nowadays.  

On a bad day when I don't do what I am supposed to do then it can be higher than that.

### Why do I take My Blood Glucose so often?

The biggest reason is ...

**Motivation**

When I see a high reading it motivates me to do something about it: 

Exercise, eat less, eat better, etc.

Likewise when I see consistantly good readings I know what I am doing is working so I can do more of it.

Measuring my blood sugar multiple times enabled me to make better choices about when to excercie and eat.

**If I could measure my blood sugar constantly I would!**

#### When I Wake Up

I take my blood sugar each morning when I wake up.  This is a fasting blood sugar reading and is a good indicator of how
my body is doing in general.  

Each night, depending on what you eat, your liver can continue to produce blood glucose even 
while you sleep.  Also your body tends to produce more glucose for you in the early morning to get you ready for your day.  

When I first started doing this, I wasn't on Metformin, and I also wasn't sticking to a good diet, or doing consistant exercise.
A normal reading for me at that time in my life was 150 or higher (which by the way is terrible).  

Today, with Metformin, regular daily exercise, and a tightly controlled diet my fasting blood sugar is typically between 80 and 115.

#### Before Lunch

My reading before lunch tells me how my breakfast affected my blood sugar.  

If the reading is really high it motivates me to: 

1.  Eat a smaller lunch
2.  Or at least make better choices regarding which types of food I eat.  
3.  It also motivates me to do my after lunch workout  

Typically the only way this reading is really high for me is if I ate terrible the day before and my morning reading was also high.

#### Before Dinner 

The third reading I take is just before Dinner.  

Again, this reading helps me make better choices about what I eat and how much I should exercise after Dinner.

If I had a healthy lunch and did my lunch-time workout then this reading will be pretty good.  

If I made bad eating choices or missed my workout after lunch then my reading will be higher, and I know that I need to make
up for it at my dinner meal by eating less or better, and by exercising after.

#### Before Bed

Finally I take my blood sugar before I go to bed.  

I have made a promise to myself to not to go to bed with high blood sugar.  

This reading for me is very helpful because it let's me know if I need to exercise one more time before I go to bed.

### Taking my blood sugar keeps me from ignoring the problem

I spent years not wanting to admit I had a problem.  Healthcare professionals call Type 2 Diabetes the silent killer because there are not a lot of easily 
noticable symptoms.  

Taking my blood sugar through out the day:

- Keeps me from ignoring the problem.
- It forces me to look the problem directly in the face and acknowledge it for what it is.
- It allows me to make better choices about what I eat, how much I eat, and when I eat
- It keeps me motivated to time my exercise in such a way that keeps my blood glucose as low as possible. 

### A1c Test and Blood Lipids

In addition to taking my blood glucose readings multiple times a day.  I also get an A1c test every three months. At the same time I also have the doctor check my cholesterol and triglycerides.

These tests allow me to see my long term progress in beating my Type 2 Diabetes.  

For those of you who are new to this, an A1C test is a blood test that provides information about a person's average levels of 
blood glucose over the past 3 months.  

It is based on the attachment of glucose to hemoglobin.  The red blood cells in your body typically live for 
about 3 months.  Thus, the A1c test reflects the average of a person's blood glucose levels over the past 3 months.

A normal A1C level is below 5.7 percent.  Keep in mind that is a level for a person who does not have diabetes and is not
pre-diabetic. 

- Normal = Below 5.7 percent
- Prediabetes = 5.7 to 6.4 percent
- Diabetes = 6.5 percent or above

I have found that my triglycerides, cholesterol and A1c seem to all be tied together.  As my A1c improves, so does my 
triglycerides and cholesterol.  Since the doctor is taking my blood for the A1c test anyway, I make sure that they are testing 
all three (a1c, triglycerides and cholesterol) so I can track my progress over time. 

### Getting a blood glucose meter

There is more than one way to get a blood glucose meter and the strips.  

A doctor is usually willing to give you a free sample meter and testing strips.  However, I have found that the meter and 
testing strips he gives you might not be the least expensive to use over time.  Especially the testing strips which can 
add up if you are testing 3 -4 times a day.  

I haven't done this personally, but I know that you can also get a prescription for the testing strips.  But as a pre-diabetic 
(and since Metformin doesn't make you go low) I was never prescribed nor did I ask to be prescribed anything for the testing 
strips.

The easiest way I found to get started testing my blood glucose was to go to my nearest drug store.  In my case, that was Walmart 
and buy the meter that looks the best to you.

For me that was the *ReliOn Ultima Blood Glucose Monitoring System*, it only cost $15 and came with some testing strips to start
me out.

I also found that the testing strips are a good price for this device.  You can get 100 strips for around $36 or 50 strips for 
around $19.

The device you choose will come with a lancelet device as well.  However I decided that if I was going to be pricking my 
finger 3 - 4 times then I wanted the best device.  

The one I like the best is the Accucheck Multiclix.  The device uses little drums of lancelets that can be changed by simply
rotating the end of the device.  Each drum holds 5 or 6 lancelets.  You can buy a pack of 102 lancelets for about $17.  

I like this device the most because the lancelets are in a drum.  It makes it much easier for me to switch to a  new lancelet and I 
don't have to see the needle.

### Conclusion

Taking my blood glucose throughout the day has been an important step in beating my Type 2 Diabetes.  I ignored and/or minimized
my problem for too long.  Taking my blood glucose throughout the day forces me to face my problem and acknowledge it for the 
serious condition that it really is. It has convinced me to make better choices about what I eat, how much I eat, and when I eat.
And it keeps me motivated to time me exercise in such a way that it keeps my blood glucose as low as possible.

If you are pre-diabetic or Type 2 Diabetic please don't ignore your condition.  It will only get worse.  Take steps today to beat
it.  I wish I had started doing this years earlier.  Nobody likes to prick their finger.  But for me the upside has been so 
beneficial that will continue to do it so that my lifestyle changes stay permenantly.
