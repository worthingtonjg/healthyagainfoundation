title: Diabetic Super Food - Chia Seed
---

Chia seeds are tiny black seeds from the plant Salvia Hispanica, which is related to the mint.  Because chia seeds are packed with nutrients but aren't high-carb foods, these seeds may show potential for people with diabetes.

1 ounce of chia seeds contains:

- 11 grams of Fiber
- 4 grams of Protein
- 9 grams of fat (5 of which oare Omega-3s)
- 18% of daily recommended Calcium
- 30% of daily recommended Magnesium
- 27% of daily recommended Phosphorus
- They also contain a decent amount of Zinc, Vitamin B3, Potassiu, Vitamin B1 and Vitamin B2 

Chia seeds are loaded with antioxidants.  Which help fight diseases like cancer.

Almost all the carbs found in chia seeds are fiber.  Fiber doesn't raise blood sugar.  

Chia seeds also absorb 10-12 times their weight in water.  This can make you feel fuller for longer and eat fewer calories.

Chia seed are an excellet source of protein. 

Due to the high fiber and protien content chia seeds can help you lose weight.

Like flax seeds, chia seeds are very high in Omega-3 fatty acids.

### Effects of Flax Seed in my diet

I use chia seed as a mixin to my protein shakes.  I usually use 1-2 tablespoons in each protein shake.  

I started using chia seed at the same time I started drinking Whey protein shakes.  I also mix ground flax seed and cinnamon into 
my protien shake.  

Since adding chia seed into my diet I have noticed a large decrease in my triglycerides and bad cholesterol.  I have also noticed
that my blood sugar is much lower.

Since I started taking the chia  seed at the same time as adding the Whey protein and flax seed into my diet, it is hard to say 
for sure how it is effecting me.  But the sum effect is positive.

And based on all the positive science that I've read on Chia seed it can only be beneficial to continue using it.
