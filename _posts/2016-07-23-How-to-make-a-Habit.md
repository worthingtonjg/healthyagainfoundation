title: How to make a Habit
---

Beating my type 2 diabetes has had a lot to do with forming new habits and breaking old habits.  This process
of breaking old habits and building new habits is difficult.  It takes patience and dedication.  And when I say dedication, I don't
mean the strength to never make a mistake.  Because successfully beating diabetes is all about moving through your mistakes and weaknesses.

>Determination mean the strength to continue trying even after you do make a mistake.

Habits are the small decisions you make and actions you perform every day.  All those small decisions add up overtime
and create your lifestyle.  

I have this quote on the wall to remind me that every little choice I make today effects who I am tomorrow:

>Now is Pivotal

I have had to change a lot of things about my lifestyle including: when I eat, what I eat, when I exercise, how 
much I exercise, and how I think about life in general.  Making these changes meant both breaking bad habits 
and making new good habits.

### Bad habits I broke

As a type 2 diabetic, I had a lot of really bad habits.  Most of these habits where around what I was eating, and when I 
was eating it.  I learned from many failures that I had to change my diet completely to beat my diabetes.  

Some of the habits I had to break were:

- Eating high fat and high carb foods
- Eating when I wasn't reall hungry either out of habit or for social reasons
- Eating at the wrong time and without doing anything to counteract its effect
- Rationalizing that what I was eating was okay because other people where eating it.

### Good habits I made

In addition to breaking my bad diet habits, I had to make a lot of new habits to beat my type 2 diabetes.  It
wasn't enough to just stop my bad habits.  To beat my diabetes I made new habits that have permenantly changed 
my lifestyle:

- I started taking my blood glucose 3 times a day
- I started taking Metformin 
- I eliminated 80% of the fatty and high carb foods in my diet
- I started eating more vegetables and other diabetic super foods
- I started exercising multiple times a day, specifically after each meal
- I made it a habit to NOT eating after 6pm 

### How I started to make new habits and break old ones

I made lots of mistakes as I was trying to beat my diabetes.  I struggled for over 9 years to get my diabetes
under control.  Much of that struggle was around breaking bad habits and creating good habits.

>The biggest mistake I made was thinking that I could be perfect at my eating and exercising.  And then when I wasn't perfect, I would fall completely off my plan and revert back to my old behavior.

This is the wrong approach. 

Research shows that willpower is like a muscle. It gets fatigued as you use it throughout 
the day. Another way to think of this is that your motivation ebbs and flows. It rises and falls. 

I found that to change my habits I had to start smaller. 

I had to pick new habits that were easier to accomplish.  For example, instead of trying to run 3 miles each day and 
then feeling like a failure when I couldn't do it, I tried to walk 1 mile three times a day.  That way if I missed
walking 1 mile, I ended up not missing the other 2 miles.

The same goes for eating.  Changing your diet is difficult, but if you do it in small ways, over time it will 
become easier.  For example, instead of cutting out all the bad stuff, just start by adding vegetables to every meal.  I found
that if I made a goal to add vegetables to every meal, even if I missed a meal, I at least got some vegetables at
one of the meals.  

### I started to increase my habit in small ways

Instead of trying to go cold
turkey and completely eliminating high fat and high carb foods from my diet, I did it a little bit at a time.  For example, 
at lunch I decided to stop having french fries.  Once this was easy, I decided to stop having cheese based meals at lunch.  Slowly 
I started eating less of what was bad for me. Until at most meals the bad foods are not even a choice for me.

>Making smaller changes incremently has made it easier for me to make lasting changes over time.  And has helped me 
have the determination to keep making these chagnes.

All of these incremental improvements add up surprisingly fast. 

I've learned that rather than trying to do something amazing from the beginning, start small and gradually improve. 
Along the way, my willpower and motivation has increased, and has made it much easier to stick to my habits long-term.

### Breaking habits into smaller parts

Another good way of sticking with a habit is to break your habits into chunks.  This works extremely well with 
exercise.  Just like in the earlier example of doing cardio, if you break exercise into smaller chunks, then
you are more likely to do it.

Trying to walk or run 3 miles per day?  Breaking this into 1 mile sessions might be easier as you make your way there.

When I started to break my exercise into chunks, I realized that **when** I exercised made a huge difference in my blood
glucose levels.  

>I started to use exercise after every meal as a tool to lower my blood sugar.  

I also found that if I missed one workout, then I could make up for it by not missing the next workout that day.

### Be persistant

Top performers make mistakes, commit errors, and get off track just like everyone else. The difference is that they 
get back on track as quickly as possible.

Research has shown that missing your habit once, no matter when it occurs, has no measurable impact on your 
long-term progress. Rather than trying to be perfect, abandon your all-or-nothing mentality.

Keep your goals small, break them into smaller chunks throughout the day.  If you miss once, make sure you make
up for it the next time.

I have found that if I can stick with my good habits and stay away from my old habits 80% of time, then I make
progress in the right direction.  

Don't let that 20% of the time when you make a mistake mess up the other 80% of your time!

Learning to be patient is perhaps the most critical skill of all. You can make incredible progress if you are 
consistent and patient.

### Set a reminder

I have found that when making a new habit it is very helpful to set a reminder for myself.  We all have things
that take up time in our life, like work and family.  And we just can't put our lives on hold to make new habits.

But if I set a reminder on my phone to exercise, or to take my blood glucose, I found that I am far more likely to 
do it.  

This was especially true early on before I was in a good habit of doing these things.

### Get in routine

Habits are all about getting in a routine.  Once a habit becomes part of your lifestyle, it becomes part of what 
your normal day means for you.

Before I started my journey a normal day did not include exercise.  It certainly did not include exercise multiple times
a day.  It did not include taking my blood glucose after every meal.

But today, these are all part of what a normal day is for me.  These are habits that have helped me overcome and beat
my diabetes. 

### Reward yourself

One thing I found was that giving myself a reward for good behavior overtime really helped me make and keep my goals.

I found that if there was something new I wanted.  Maybe it was a new electronic, or a new pair of shoes.  

If I set a goal to create a new habit, and then rewarded myself with this new thing that it really helped me want to 
be more consistent in keeping my goals.
