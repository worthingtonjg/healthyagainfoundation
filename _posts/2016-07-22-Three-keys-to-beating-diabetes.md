title: Three keys to beating diabetes
---

I am here today to tell you that I have personally beat diabetes!  And so can you!

> Beating my diabetes has not been easy.  It has meant making complete and permanent lifestyle changes.  I have had to change the way I think about food, my body and my life. 

From my 10 year struggle to beat diabetes, I have found that diabetes can be beat but never fully eradicated.  The cure to diabetes
is living a new life, eating healthy foods, and taking care of your body.   

Through my struggle I have found three keys that I used to beat my diabetes: 

1.  Medication
2.  Exercise
3.  Diet

For me just one or two aproaches didn't work.  

- I tried excercise on its own.  
- I tried diet on its own.  
- I tried diet and exercise.  
- I tried just medication.
  
I tried every combination of the above and got some results.  However nothing worked for me fully until I applied all three keys to my lifestyle.  My body needed all three keys to fully respond 
and change in the ways that I wanted for it to change.  

### You have to admit to yourself you have a problem
