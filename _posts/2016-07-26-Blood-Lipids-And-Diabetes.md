title: Blood Lipids And Diabetes
---

I want to go out on a limb and say that a high fat diet contributes more to diabetes than a high sugar diet.  Initially, as a 
type 2 diabetic I was so focused on my sugar intake, I let my fat intake take a back seat.  But the reality is that your 
fat intake has potentially as much of (if not a greater impact) on your insulin resistance than your sugar intake.

### How I have changed my blood lipids  

One really big change that I have made in my diet, that has significantly decreased my blood sugar, is to reduce (and in some cases)
eliminate completely high fat foods in my diet.   

I no longer eat (at least 80% of the time):

- Anything fried (french fries, onion rings, etc.)
- Anything cheese based (pizza, enchiladas)
- Fatty meats (ground beef, pork, etc.)

### How this has changed my life

Not only has this improved my blood glucose, but my triglycerides have gone from 900+ down to 100.  And my cholesterol has 
drastically improved as well.

> Before making this change, these were all staples of my diet.  All my favorite foods came from one of these high-fat categories.

### So what's the problem with a high fat diet?

The problem with these foods is that they are all high in fat.  

New studies have shown that a high-fat diet can result in insulin resisance.  

> Insulin resistance is caused by lipid overload, resulting from either a high fat diet or insufficient fat “burning” through 
movement.

Studies show that prolonged exposure of skeletal muscle and myocytes to high levels of fatty acids leads to severe insuline 
resistance.  Studies further show that saturated fatty acid intake can result in:

- Mitochondrial dysfunction in the muscle and liver
- Production of free radicals in the muscle and liver
- Cellular inflammation in the muscle and liver

### You have to watch your fats as well as your carbs 

Too often, the blame is placed on carbohydrates as the cause of insulin resistance despite the fact that the evidence clearly 
supports that excessive fat consumption causes excessive fat storage.

I have found first hand that lowering my blood glucose and beating diabetes is more than just eating fewer lower quality carbs.

To see real changes I have had to cut out the fatty food from my diet.

Let me just say this again.  I know it is hard to accept.  It was really hard for me to accept and even harder to implement.

> Stop eating fried food.  Stop eating chease based meals.  Stop eating fatty meats.

If you are diabetic, these foods are literally killing you one bite at a time.

### Cardiovasular disease and diabetes

The statistics speak loud and clear that there is a strong correlation between cardiovascular disease and diabetes.

At least 68 percent of people age 65 or older with diabetes will die from some form of heart disease or stroke.

Patients with diabetes often have unhealthy cholesterol levels including high LDL ("bad") cholesterol, low HDL ("good") cholesterol, 
and high triglycerides. 

I know this was the case for me.  My triglycerides and cholesterol were off the charts.  The higher these numbers got, the higher 
my blood glucose readings were.

This triad of poor lipid counts often occurs in patients with premature coronary heart disease. It is also characteristic of a lipid 
disorder associated with insulin resistance called atherogenic dyslipidemia, or diabetic dyslipidemia in those patients with diabetes. 

### Conclusion 

A high fat diet contributes to insulin resistance and diabetes at least as much (if not more) than a high carb diet.  By 
cutting out high fat foods, including fried foods, cheese based meals, and fatty meats I have greatly decreased my triglycerides, 
cholesterol and blood glucose.  

The struggle to beat my diabetes is intense.  Giving up my favorite foods is not easy.  It's a decision I make each day.  Some
days I am able to follow my diet and other days I don't.  I have to admit some days I eat Pizza.  And other days I might have
a couple of fries from my kids happy meal. But because of the positive impact I have seen, I never want to go 
back to eating these types of foods regularly ever again.
