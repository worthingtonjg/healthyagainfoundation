title: Metformin

There are other diabetes medications out there, but Metformin is the most prescribed medication because it has the fewest 
side effects. At the end of 2014 the doctor suggested I start taking Metformin, 2000mg a day.  

The worst (and only) side effect I have from it is really bad gas.  This can be embarrasing during the day, so to minimize this 
problem, I always take it at dinner so most of the problem happens while I sleep.  

If it get's really bad I sleep on the couch so my wife doesn't get grossed out.  

### My experience on Metformin

Taking Metformin has been a miracle for me.  

>Before I started taking Metformin my blood sugar was consistently above 180, and sometimes above 200.
  
In the first 6 months taking Metformin I actually lost 15 pounds.  And my blood sugar stayed under 150
even with sporadic exercise and limited diet changes.

Today I am on 500 mg of Metformin.  My fasting blood sugar is regularly under 100.  

With Metformin, diet and exercise I have seen a huge steady improvement in my health over the last couple of years.

### Multiple Benefits of Metformin

Metformin has been used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes for the past 40 years.  It originates from the French lilac or goats rue, 
a plant used in folk medicine for several centuries.  It was first discovered in 1922, but was not approved for use in the United States until 1995.

Metformin works by increasing insulin sensitivity.  Therefore, metformin is not associated with causing low blood 
sugar (or hypoglycemia).  

Metformin reduces fasting plasma glucose levels by -60 to -70mg/dl in patients with non-insulin dependent type 2 
diabetes.  It also reduces hmoglobin A1C levels.

Metformin has also been shown to promote weight loss, decrease fasting insulin levels, decrease total cholesterol,
and increase ldl cholesterol.

Metformin has been found to suppress the growth of some tumors and enhance the activity of anti-cancer drugs.

### Side effects

As I mentioned the only side effect I have suffered is bad gas.  

However people who have a history of kidney or liver disease should not take Metformin.

The most serious potential side effect is lactic acidosis.  Which is the build of lactate in the body, and 
in extreme cases can be fatal.
