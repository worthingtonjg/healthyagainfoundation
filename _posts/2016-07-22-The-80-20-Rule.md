title: The 80 20 Rule
---

What I’ve learned with my struggle with Type 2 Diabetes is that nobody (especially me) is perfect. I found that I just can’t be 
perfect all the time on my diet.

> Food is just too good. I love it too much.

Whatever your favorite food “crack” is (For me it is Pizza), you won’t be able to avoid it all the time.

There will be times where you break down and eat foods you know are bad for you.

And that is okay, but only 

> If It is less than 20% of the time.

Like most things in life, I try to follow the 80/20 rule, and things turn out okay.

### The 80/20 principle is no diet 

It's a lifestyle change that can lead to sustainable weight loss and glucose control. 

The breakdown is simple: 

> 80 percent of the time you focus on eating clean, good-for-you foods, and 20 percent of the time you have the freedom to indulge 
as you please. 

### As a Type 2 Diabetic what you eat greatly effects your blood glucose.

But since you can just plan on not being perfect at least 20% of the time.  You have to be able to offset those imperfect choices.

That is where exercise and medication come in.

I quickly realized that I can minimize and offset the effect of what I eat by excercising at the right times, and eating 
better at other meals.

So early on, I realized (from sad experience) that I could not be perfect. 

> I planned on not being perfect.

I made a promise to myself to not let an imperfect meal destroy my entire day, week or month.

I just remember, each time, to tell myself to eat better at the next meal.

I have found that if I can follow my eating rules 80% of the time then I will be far better off than not trying at all.

### Finding Balance

What does this mean?

- It means that on birthdays/holidays/special occasions you can have a piece of cake.
- It means you’re building a lifestyle, not just following a diet.
- It means you don’t have to be perfect 100% of the time.

In life and nutrition, it’s all about finding a balance. Because as much as you know that proper nutrition will get you the body you 
want, boost your performance and allow you to live a long, healthy, active life, you also want to be able to just live.

And the 80/20 principle allows you to do that.

Because while you should always aim to eat healthy most of the time, aiming for about 80% of the time gives you that wiggle room every 
sane person needs to still enjoy themselves.
