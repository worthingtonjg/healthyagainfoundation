title: Diabetic Super Food - Flax Seed
---

The claimed health benefits of flaxseed range from the prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease to help in controlling the 
blood glucose levels of type 2 diabetics.

Flax seed is high in dietary fiber, lignans and omega-3 fatty acids (ALA).  

Flax seed has been reported to lower cholesterol levels, and reduce triglycerides.

Evidence suggests that people who eat a diet rich in ALA are less likely to have a fatal heart attack. This may be because flaxseed 
helps prevent heart attacks and strokes by reducing the inflammation associated with plaque build-up in the arteries.

### Effects of Flax Seed in my diet

I use flax seed as a mixin to my protein shakes.  I usually use 1-2 tablespoons in each protein shake.  

I started using flax seed at the same time I started drinking Whey protein shakes.  I also mix chia seed and cinnamon into 
my protien shake.  

Since adding flax seed into my diet I have noticed a large decrease in my triglycerides and bad cholesterol.  I have also noticed
that my blood sugar is much lower.

Since I started taking the flax seed at the same time as adding the Whey protein and chia seed into my diet, it is hard to say 
for sure how it is effecting me.  But the sum effect is positive.

And based on all the positive science that I've read on Flax seed it can only be beneficial to continue using it.
