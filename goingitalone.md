### Disclaimer

Before starting any new diet and exercise program please check with your doctor and clear any exercise and/or diet 
changes with them before beginning. I am not a doctor or registered dietitian. I do not claim to cure any cause, 
condition or disease. I do not provide medical aid or nutrition for the purpose of health or disease and claim to be a 
doctor or dietitian.

I am in direct ability and use of conversation under following articles.

### MEDICAL/HEALTH DISCLAIMER

All information is intended only to help you cooperate with your doctor, in your efforts toward desirable weight levels and health. Only your doctor can determine what is right for you. In addition to regular check ups and medical supervision, from your doctor, before starting any other weight loss program, you should consult with your personal physician.

All information is generalized, presented for informational purposes only, not medical advice, and presented “as is” without warranty or guarantee of any kind. Readers are cautioned not to rely on this information as medical advice and to consult a qualified medical, dietary, fitness or other appropriate professional for their specific needs.

This information has not been evaluated by the FTC, FDA or any other government agency and that this information is not intended to “diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease.”

A Federal Trade Commission (FTC) study by a panel of experts concluded the following: That proper weight loss is achieved by reducing caloric intake and/or increasing physical activity. Individuals maintaining weight losses over the long term do so by changing their diet and changing their physical activity.

Although there are common characteristics among the relevant population, there is not a single cause of overweight or obesity. In some people, the cause may be more closely linked to genetic factors while in other instances, the principal causal factor may be environmental. Moreover, it should be obvious that diets, metabolic rates, and levels of physical activity vary from one individual to another and that weight loss levels will vary. Weight loss results for one individual are not to be viewed as typical for another individual.

Rapid weight loss may also be associated with some medical problems. Individuals undergoing weight loss can experience physical changes in the body (dizziness, interruptions in the menstrual cycle, hair loss, for example) that may indicate more serious conditions. People noticing such changes should be advised to talk immediately to their primary care physician.

Children and adolescents, pregnant or breast feeding women, and people with significant health problems such as bulimia, heart disease, kidney disease, diabetes or psychiatric disorder, should not begin this program without written authorization by their primary care provider.

People under treatment for other conditions or taking medications prescribed by their health care provider should tell their providers that they have begun this diet because, in some cases, adjustments to medications or modifications to the weight loss program may be appropriate.
