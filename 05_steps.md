Please keep in mind that the opinions expressed below are NOT medical advice.  Please read my full disclaimer here.

This is just what worked for me.  This is what my body responded best to and what worked for me.  

Do not stop taking your medication or do anything I've done unless your doctor tells you that it is okay in your situation. 

Please note that I am a Type 2 Diabetic.  And that I was never on Insulin for my diabetes.  

Luckily, I acted soon enough to prevent that from being my reality.  If you are on Insulin be very careful about when and what you 
eat because you do not want your blood sugar to go low and you should follow your doctor's advice and please do not think that what 
worked for me might work for you.

I worked closely with a nutritionist and a doctor and without their help I would not have been successful.  

### Why Diet and Exercise alone didn't work for me.

I tried for 9 years to beat my Diabetes on my own.  I tried every diet out there to lose weight.  I hit the treadmill endlessly 
and for hours but was not able to keep my Diabetes under control.  By the time reality shocked me into action my A1c was 10.7, 
my Triglycerids where over 1000, and my Cholesterol was just as bad.  If I didn't change something (and fast) I was going to 
have to go on Insulin.

I wasn't able to beat diabetes on my own with just diet and exercise.  My main problem was and will always be will power.  

None of us can be perfect.

And when you have type 2 diabetes every slip up in your diet or missed excercise can have consequences.  So to balance out your 
imperfections you need medication.  If you done correctly the medication won't be a forever thing.  But you have to get your body
back into line and the medication will help you do that. 

Please do not take as long as I took to realize you can't fix everything on your own.  Once I realized this I was able
to get by diabetes under control with a three-prong approach.  

### My Three Pronged Approach

I beat my diabetes with a three pronged approach.  Below are links to each topic and what I did to reach my goals:
