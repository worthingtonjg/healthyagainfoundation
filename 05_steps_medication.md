The biggest mistake I made was to resist / delay getting medical help.  I did this for several reasons:

1.  Doctor's didn't convey to me how serious the problem was
2.  I thought I could beat it myself through diet and excercise
3.  I was scared of being on a mediciation for the rest of my life
4.  I was scared to admit how bad my problem was.

Does any of this sound familiar?  

Please, Please don't wait.  

Diabetes is a progressive disease that only gets worse and harder to beat if you do nothing, or if
you don't do enough to stop it's progression.

### Medication

The medication I take is called Metformin.  

The worst (and only) side effect I have from it is really bad gas.  This can be embarrasing during the day, so to minimize this 
problem, I always take it at Dinner so most of the problem happens while I sleep.  If it get's really bad I sleep on the couch
so my wife doesn't get grossed out.  

There are other medications out there.  But Metformin is the most prescribed medication because it has the fewest side effects.

One known possible side effect of Metformin is Lactic Acidosis.  But I never experienced this problem

### My experience on Metformin

Taking Metformin has been a miracle for me.  Before I started taking Metformin my blood sugar was consistently above 180, and
sometimes above 200.  In the first 6 months taking Metformin I actually lost 15 pounds.  And my blood sugar stayed under 150
even without exercise or diet changes.  Now 150 wasn't good enough for me.  At that level I was still causing damage to my 
organs and at risk of Heart Disease.  Also it wasn't correcting my problem with High Triglycerids or Cholesterol. 

### Why I Measure My Blood Glucose

One thing you need to know is not all doctor's are experts on diabetes.  One thing I heard from more than one doctor's is that
I didn't need to take my blood glucose daily if I was on Metformin and was a Type 2 Diabetic.

This is terrible advice!  

This advice mainly comes from the fact that Metformin will not make your blood sugar go too low.  People who take Insulin can
have their blood sugar go low - which is very dangerous.  You can die from low blood sugar very quickly.  

Whereas High Blood Sugar will only kill you slowly over time via Heart Disease, Kidney Failure, Blindness etc.

So I guess if you are okay with that, then feel free not to check your blood sugar regularly.  I for one would rather live a long
and quality life free from these problems.

### How Often Do I Measure My Blood Glucose?

I know nobody likes to prick their finger (especially not multiple times a day).  But if you aren't measuring your blood sugar
then there is no way for you to know if what you are doing is being effective.

I check my blood sugar 3-4 times a day:

1.  When I wake up
2.  Before Lunch
3.  Before Dinner
4.  Before I go to bed

Why do I do this?

- The biggest reason is motivation.  
- When I see a high reading it motivates me to do something about it.  Exercise, eat less, etc.
- Likewise when I see consistantly good readings I know what I am doing is working so I can do more of it
- Measuring my blood sugar multiple times enabled me to make better choices about when to excercie and eat 
- If I could measure my blood sugar constantly I would!
