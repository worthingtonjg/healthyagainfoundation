title: How I Beat Type 2 Diabetes With Diet

As a diabetic, I learned that I could simply not eat the same foods as other people and expect for things to be okay.

I found that my diet had to be very strict.  

And that means unfortunately there are many foods I just can't eat.  

But I also found that there are some specific foods that are really good for Diabetics and have helped me control my diabetes
to an extent that wasn't possible with just medication or exercise

### Lesson 1 - Cheating on your Diet 

What I've learned is that nobody (especially me) is perfect.  I found that I just can't be perfect all the time on my diet.

Food is just too good.  I love it too much.  Whatever your favorite food "crack" is (For me it is Pizza), you won't be able to 
avoid it all the time.  

There will be times where you break down and eat foods you know are bad for you. 

And that is okay, but only IF ...

It is less than 20% of the time.  

Like most things in life, if you follow the 80/20 rule, things will be okay.

Also you can minimize the effect of what you eat by excercising at the right times, and eating better at other meals.

So right now, plan to not be perfect.  But don't let that destroy your entire day, week or month.  Just remember to tell yourself
to eat better at the next meal.  If you can follow your rules 80% of the time then you will be far better off than not trying 
at all.    
 
### When to eat

Diabetes is called the quite killer because often times there are no symptoms.  But for me, if my blood sugar is high, then I 
get tingly and burning in my feet and toes.  It is possible that this is the starting of permanent nerve damage, but I've never
had that checked.  All I know is that for me it makes it very difficult for me to sleep if my blood sugar is high.

So one if the best rules that has been life changing for me is that I simply do not eat after 6pm.

I know this sounds harsh but as a diabetic this is a fact of life you need to learn to live with.  Now, if I was on Insulin, 
then this would probably not be a great rule to follow, since I may need to eat in conjuction with my Insulin shots.  But 
with Metformin, it works for me.  

I make sure to eat dinner before 6pm, and if necessary I exercise around 8pm to get my blood sugar down to a reasonable level.

Then I can go to sleep with blood sugar in the normal range - which means for at least 8 hours each day I have blood sugar that
is in a healthy range.

Just think - that means from this one simple trick (plus strategically timed excercising) I can keep my blood sugar in a healthy 
range for 33% of the time! 

### When not to eat

I have found that eating, in some cases, is more of a habit than a necessity for me.  I am not saying that I starve myself.  But
I am saying that I don't eat just because it is time to eat.  

- If my blood sugar is high and I am not hungry then I will frequently skip a meal.
- Likewise if I know that I won't be able to exercise after a meal, and I am not too hungry then I may also skip a meal
- I have never skipped more than one meal in a row
- And I don't do this very frequently, but it can be a good tool to control your blood sugar in specific situations

### What Not to Eat

For a diet to be successful it has to be a lifestyle change.  

As a diabetic, one of the main problems I have is that my cells and my blood are all messed up.  

Which means Insulin can't get into my cells when my blood and body are in this messed up state.  

I realized that fixing this can't happen overnight.  It took me years of unheathly eating habits to put my body in this state,
and it will take me years (and possibly a lifetime) to correct it.  

To do this, to start this change, I realized I had to change what I eat.

I had to change the way I thought about food.  

For me the following types of food are literally poisen as a Type 2 Diabetic:

- Sugar Drinks (Soda, Fruit Juice, Milk) 
- All fried food
- Cheese based meals (think pizza, enchiladas etc.)
- All Breads and Pasta
- White Rice
- Most Breakfast Cereal
- Fatty Meats
- Junk Food (Chips, Pop-tarts, Cookies, snacks etc)

I knew that if I wanted  change my body and my life then I needed to stop doing the following:

- Stop drinking my calories (no soda, no milk, no fruit juice)
- Stop eating fried food (Yes, that meant no French Fries, Onion Rings etc)
- Stop eating cheese based meals (seriously there is cheese on everything - and yes that means no Pizza or Enchiladas)
- Stop eating sweets (cake, donughts, candy etc.)
- Stop eating bread (unless it whole grain, high fiber - and then only sparingly)
- Limit the Fatty meats (hamburgers, hot dogs, etc.)
- Stop eating the Junk Food (bye-bye Strawberry Poptarts)

This list isn't exhaustive, there are other things I shouldn't eat as well, but I use my common sense to decide what is good or bad for me.   

I can tell you from experience this wasn't easy.  These things are hard to give up.  Food is a drug and I am addicted to it.

But I knew that if you want to beat the disease then I had to change what I ate (at least 80% of the time)

### What you should eat 

So we've talked about what I try not to eat.  Now let's talk about what I know I should eat:

- Vegetables (yes - you need to eat these with every meal, seriously there is no way around this)
- Lean Protien (eggs, turkey, chicken, fish)
- Fruit (in moderation and only before I excercise)
- Diabetes fighting food


I realize this list looks small, but it really isn't.  There are hundreds of kinds of vegetables.  I try to eat vegetables
with every meal now.  Which is actually a huge change for me.  I used to never eat vegetables (ever).  

I also switched the type of meat I typically eat.  Instead of hamburger and hotdogs (which where a staple of my diet), I now
eat eggs, turkey, chicken and fish (although I have a hard time with fish).

I do still eat Fruit, but it raises my blood sugar a lot, so I try to limit it to pre-workout snacks.

Finally I have found a list of foods that have drastically helped me lower and control my blood sugar.  These foods are foods
that I call Diabetes Fighting Food, and I try to eat these every day. 


### Diabetes Fighting Foods

I have used all the following foods to drastically lower my blood sugar.  Keep in mind that I am doing this as part of a three
pronged approach of medication, exercise and diet.  I didn't try these foods by themselves.  I suspect that they would work by 
themselves, but I don't think they will solve the problem unless you do all the steps.

- Lemons
- Cinnamon
- Whey Protein
- Old Fashion Oatmeal (non-instant kind) 
- Ground Flax Seed
- Chia Seed
- Blue Berries

#### Lemons

Using lemons in my diet lowers my blood sugar 30 - 50 points.  

Lemon Juice Drink
- Peel 3-6 lemons (depending on size)
- Slice the lemons up and throw them in a blender with some water
- Blend them up, then strain them to get the seeds and bigger chunks out
- Put in a 2 Qt pitcher and fill with more water to the top
- Drink this every day

#### Cinnamon

Just like lemons Cinnaomon lowers my blood sugar 30 - 50 points.  But you have to use quite a bit of it

I use Cinnamon in two things ...

- My Whey Protien drink
- My Oatmeal (not the pre-packaged high glycemic stuff - you have to use the real authentic oatmeal that you have to boil) 

And I use a lot of it.  When I say a lot, I don't mean a little sprinkle.  I mean at least 1 tablespoon.  More if you can stand 
the strength.  But don't put too much in - you still have to be able to eat it.

I also have taken Cinnamon pills, but I prefer to use Cinnamon in my food 

#### Whey Protein Drink

- Filling, Keeps you full
- Used as a delivery mechanism for the Cinnamon, Flax Seed and Chia seed
- Useful to build muscle
- Regulates my blood sugar


#### Old Fashion Oatmeal

I am not a lover of Oatmeal, but I have come to like it for several reasons.  Now when I talk about Oatmeal, this isn't the sugar
packed oatmeal that you get in the packs and can be heated in the microwave.  That stuff is terrible for you and will raise your
blood sugar drastically.  

I am talking about the good old fashioned oats, the kind you have to boil on the stove. 

And no, I don't add any sugar to it.  Instead I add Cinnamon and Blueberries.  Both of which are super foods that lower
your blood sugar levels. 

#### Ground Flax Seed / Chia Seed Blend

These are both high in Omega-3's which for me is good because I don't eat a lot of fish.  I put this mixture in my Protien shake
and I have seen a huge improvement in my blood lipids from doing this.

#### Blue Berries

Another diabetic super food.  I put these in my Oatmeal, or eat a handful in the morning with my shake.
